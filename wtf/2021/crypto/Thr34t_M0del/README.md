Whitfield and Martin are threat modelers who use password protected files. They use the following method of arriving at the password: P = 8191 a and b are Merssene primes. G is related to a and b such that (a*b)-G = 14 The final key is 4278, while the password = (a+1)th term of the Geometric progression where G = a0, b = r
