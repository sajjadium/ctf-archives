"When her neon dreams shatter into encrypted fragments… can you trace the echoes of her lost truth?"

Legends whisper of a lone girl wandering the rain-slicked streets of Night City, chasing a cryptic relic known only as R3LOAD, a digital ghost said to hold the key to her fractured past. But the data-core was shredded by the rogue AI Disassembler into 11,423 encrypted fragments, each warped by a unique cipher, their glow dimmed beneath the city’s smog. Only those who dare to dive into the abyss of code can follow the trail she left behind.

Hack the Disassembler's core, decrypt the fragments, and rebuild her truth before Night City's pulse drowns her final whisper.
