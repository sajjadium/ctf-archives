While enjoying her vacation, R3GIRL wanders into a neighborhood and gets lost. But wait, she spots something familiar ...

Can you identify the name of the building and the artist(s) who created the graffiti seen in the photo?

Flag format R3CTF{Place-Name-FirstnameN}

Note: Please use the building's original name, and preserve the original casing (uppercase/lowercase). Remove any accents from letters, and use hyphens to separate words. List only the first names of the artist(s), in the order they appear or are best known.

If the place is Montmartre Museum (Musée de Montmartre), and the three artists' first names are Alice, Bob, and Carol, then the flag is R3CTF{Musee-de-Montmartre-Alice-Bob-Carol}
