ELF

In the sprawling data-slums of Guangzhou, they call him the Time Warden, a digital phantom obsessed with data purity. Under his iron-fisted '80-Byte Mandate,' all corporate code has been compressed to its theoretical limit, leaving no space for secrets, no room for dissent. But a final, defiant whisper echoes from the core systems: a rogue sysadmin, just before being zeroed, encoded a vital secret - the /flag - not in a file, but as the file itself. To retrieve it, you must forge a ghost in the machine: an 80-byte ELF executable, the absolute minimum for existence on the x86-64 architecture. You have no room for error and no space for a single wasted byte. You must bend the laws of digital physics, forcing the executable's fundamental structure to carry out your will and make this digital corpse walk, or the Warden's final sweep will erase the truth forever.
