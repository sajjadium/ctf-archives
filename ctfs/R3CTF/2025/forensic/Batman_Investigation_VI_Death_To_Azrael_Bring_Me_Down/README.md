Jean Paul: "Cruz's last location is this underground sewers, this is same place Alan Wayne was found dead naked decades ago!" Jason Todd: "Don't make a move Jean, Bruce is not around, we need to handle this better, retreat, your signal is getting weaker" Jean Paul: "I can't let Cruz down like this, I have to save her, she wants us to save her, I feel something is wrong, I have to go in, I haven't got a choice! If anything happens to Jessica Cruz, Azrael will take me over!" Jason Todd: "Jean, I exactly know what it's to wait for someone to save you,until the last moment of Joker 's torture I had the hope of Bruce saving me, thanks to lazarus for the life I live now!" Jean Paul: "Jason, The green lantern corps can't contact her with her ring, I am very concerned, she saved me from the monster I was!" Jason Todd: "Enough of your personality split up, This is serious, retreat right now!" Jean Paul: "What do you know about him?, Azrael is not an alter ego, split personality or a mental identity, Azrael is a demon, he calls himself the angel of vengence, death or whatsoever, He is a monster trained by the order! He killed bane, the same man who broke Batman's back, Cruz helped me bury him, It's a flogging dead horse without her!" Jason Todd: "Jean, mate I know you are him, so please retreat!" Jean Paul: "I aaaaammmmm ssssooooooo........" Jason Todd: "Jean!! The signal is gone for god's sake!"

Jean Paul falls through a hole in the ground Jean wakes up screaming -- Surrounded by Talons

Jean Paul: "Who are you?" Talon removes his mask, Jean looks at a kent face Talon: "Hello Azrael, don't you recognize me?..... well I am Thomas.....Thomas Wayne Jr.!" Jean Paul: "What? How is this possible? You are not Bruce's father!" Thomas Wayne: "Do I look that old? I am Bruce's brother, I was an infant when my parents died, I grew up with the owls, they taught me what the purpose of life is." Jean Paul: "Where is Jessica Cruz?, Why is my vision becoming blurry? what are these illusions?" Thomas Wayne: "Welcome to the Courtttt!!"

Jean goes through a series of illusions, he sees his past, his present and his future, he sees the death of Jessica Cruz, he sees himself killing her, he sees himself killing Batman, he sees himself killing the entire bat family, he has visions of fighting with the owls, he sees himself becoming the monster he was, he has conversations with Azrael, he sees talons killing Cruz and he is helpless! he is back obeying St Dumas and executing their assasinations

Jean Paul: "Enough of this, which is real and which is not, I got wounds and fighting for days and you try to hurt me as mentally as possible?, I can't do this anymore with cowards like you! Call yourself court of Camelions, you are nothing but a bunch of cowards hiding under the city!"

Group of talons jump surrounding Jean Paul, Tired Helpless Jean finally gives up and takes the last resort

Jean yells : "Azrael, it's time..."

The Bat familiy arrives at the scene, they see Jean in the ground, fainted with blood all around him, they see many talons laying dead, faces butchered, multiple sword cuts... Jean wakes up!

Jean Paul: "aghhhhh.....Did he make it? was it worth it? did he win?" Bruce Wayne: "Azrael?, if so he sent us a wonky file and what ever necessary to decrypt it further, he made sure no one gets the information about the court of owls, with that we can bring them down, he mentionmed the court already infected you phone with a malware, we need the last hash to get all their locations and operations down!" Jean Paul: "I don't remeber anything bruce, but i can't feel him trying to take over me anymore, did he see something that I shouldn't?, did he kill himself?, We need to get this done!" Dick Grayson: "Azrael sent a message , it was "take care of Jean, I won't be around!" David Zavimbe: "Let's end this owls first, we don't have more time, with this scene here, they will already be on their next plan!" Bruce Wayne: "I will get the hellbat, I will hunt them down, you guys finish the job, Jason! Tim! Duke! with me!"
