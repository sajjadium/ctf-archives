crazyman is a malware analyst and we found this strange file called rules on his computer and README.md that says:

❯ yr scan -C rules flag.txt
Congratulations! You have found the flag!
FindFlag flag.txt
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 1 file(s) scanned in 0.1s. 1 file(s) matched.

Can you help us find the contents of flag.txt, which could be important to us?

hash.md5(flag) == "e4cae2987988c6e69cd546615368d23a"
