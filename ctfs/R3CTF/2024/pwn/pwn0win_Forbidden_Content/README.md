"We are becoming more and more open now!" They said. "Our documents, including those outside the sandbox, are available for everyone to read!"

But there are still many things that are deliberately hidden...

Please pack your exploit into a regular and installable IPA file. And open a ticket to start challenge. You will have 10 minutes to pwn the challenge. During the attempt, you can request any form of restart or environment reset.

Note: Flag is in /var/jb/var/root/flag with -r-------- 1 root wheel. We have configured the sandbox profile so the two services in the attachment are reachable within the iOS sandbox.

    We use an iPhone 8 with iOS 16.7.1 for this challenge.
    We highly recommend you test your exploitation on jailbroken devices or Corellium or any emulators like t8030-qemu / D22-QEMU first.
    Free feel to ask admin for temporary Corellium access in case you need.
