Santa Claus is making this year's Christmas extra special with a worldwide treasure hunt! All participants have been given a photograph showing the exact location where gifts will be distributed. Everyone who arrives at this location on Christmas Eve will receive a special gift from Santa himself. Can you use your skills to find where Santa is waiting?

Submit the exact name of this location to claim your gift! For example, if the picture was taken in the lobby of the Willis Tower, you would simply submit Willis Tower.
