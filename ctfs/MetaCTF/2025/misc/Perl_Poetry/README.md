Happy Holidays! Santa Claus needs your help to save Christmas. An APT known as "Krampus" has infiltrated Santa Claus's poetry site and locked him out completely. However, Santa can't wipe the server since it also stores important files like the flag that he didn't backup. Your job: Get back in and retrieve the flag to save Christmas, hopefully Krampus hasn't already started encrypting files...
