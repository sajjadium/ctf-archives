Santa's making final preparations with his finalized nice list, but his laptop isn't allowing him to access the new admin panel made by his elves. Since he only has a few names left on the list, he got an elf to send an encrypted screenshot of the page, but he lost the encryption key! He's too embarrassed to ask for help again, so can you figure out how to read the list and help Santa finish his preparations?
