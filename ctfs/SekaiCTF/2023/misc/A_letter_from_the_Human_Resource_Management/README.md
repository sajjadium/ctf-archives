Boss
Tell me more!
Hello, worker! It’s really great to see you again after our 42 years of hard work. I almost thought you would never come back when you left for the other 7 billion. The employee, as usual, has sent you the instructions, and said something like... “You should get a big check mark if everything goes well.” I don’t really know what that means, but it must be something promising. The Facilities Management has left you some notes on the floor. Consult them when in doubt. They must be very useful. I believe you can do a good job, just like the last 42 years. Good luck! Your presence is requested on the next floor, Management
