I was going to create this extremely easy forensics challenge for you, but accidentally used the flag as the password when I encrypted the archive. This flag is now deleted, and since it is not possible to brute-force it, I guess that means this challenge can no longer be solved, or can it?

The script to generate the challenge is included.
