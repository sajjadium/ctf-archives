[ 5 aug 2024 ] Just finished my ecommerce website. It took quite a lot of time because I wanted to make sure it's extra secure, I'm sure it will get some traction. I'm so excited!

[ 20 aug 2024 ] The website isn't picking up as i hoped it would, but I'm still optimistic

[ 13 sep 2024 ] The store is a complete bust and there is this annoying customer that keeps on checking my store every other damn minute but doesn't buy anything.

[ 13 sep 2024 ] JUST BUY SOMETHING!
