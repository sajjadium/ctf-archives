You have been trying to infiltrate the L3ak office for some time, and your friend just gave you this mysterious snapshot. What information can you glean from it?

For Q4: The format should read "OS, Workstation".

For Q5: This question is asking about "workstations". Based on the names of the computers you have found, which of these apply to this question?

For Q7: You only need to place the hex value one time at the very end of your answer. Example: user1, user2, 0xXXXXX (number of X's not accurate to the answer). These users will be employees.

For Q12: I apologize there is an error in the solution. If you have found the correct answer, swap the last two values and it will be correct.
