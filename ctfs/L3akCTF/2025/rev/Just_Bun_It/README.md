The Buniverse is in trouble, and only the cleverest bunnies can crack the code! The secret flag is hidden, and you'll need to nibble your way through some tricky numbers to find it. Don't let this challenge carrot away from you—put on your thinking ears and get ready to bun-leash your skills!

Contestants are provided with a mysterious binary named runme and a file called input.txt containing pairs of numbers. This binary takes in two numbers as command-line arguments. For example: ./runme 4843 0.362 This will print a single character (e.g., l).

To find the whole flag, feed each pair of numbers from input.txt to the binary (one pair at a time) and collect all the characters!

Can you out-hop the rest and claim the flag? Good luck, and may your paws be swift and your guesses un-fur-gettable!

Note: The flag starts with l3ak instead of L3AK! l3ak{...}
