I split the flag into 5 pieces, hashed each one, and hid them within a text file among many other hashes. Moreover, I used several different obscure hash algorithms and multiple hash iterations to enhance their security. Unless you have a supercomputer or possess arcane hash-cracking magic that can find the needles within the hashstack, there's no possible way for you to find the flag!!! Evil cackling.

Use the Wictionary top 100,000 most frequently-used English words as the wordlist, and best64.rule as your rule file.

The order of passwords 1-5 in the flag is based on the order of their hashes in hashes.txt (i.e., the first hash = pass 1, etc.).

Flag format: L3AK{pass1_pass2_pass3_pass4_pass5}
