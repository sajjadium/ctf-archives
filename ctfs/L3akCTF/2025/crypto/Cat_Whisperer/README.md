I'm so tired of people cracking my hashes. Luckily, I found a brilliant, foolproof solution - I'm locking away the flag on my secure server and the only thing you can provide is the rule file >:)

Submit a hashcat rule file to the remote service. It will run hashcat -m 1400 -r <your_rule.rule> hash.txt flag.txt where hash.txt contains this strange hash:

502a9ed8aa3938b1828e3cf31d6414b3e3d674ba318e06414be09318ccddb9e4

Cats speak to us plenty...but do we really understand what they're saying?
