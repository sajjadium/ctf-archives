Around 5 years ago, I made this killer program that encodes the string into a cyphertext. The unique feature of this program is that for the same exact plaintext, it generates a different cyphertext every time you run the program. Yesterday I was nosing around in some old stuff and found an encrypted message!

Sadly I realized that I lost the decryption program. I have the encryption program though. Do you think you can help me out and decrypt this message for me?
