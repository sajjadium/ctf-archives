Poor Yooz, his only mistake is that he can't remember things very well!!

Useful timeline for the investigation:

Suspicious network traffic was detected
The employee, Ree Yooz, was disconneceted from his workstation session
The packet capture was stopped and saved. Further suspicous network traffic was noticed after that
A memory dump of the workstation has been taken
The flag is in two parts.
Flag format: shellmates{part1part2}
