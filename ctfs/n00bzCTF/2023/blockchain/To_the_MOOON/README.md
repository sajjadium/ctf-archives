Because cryptocurrency is entirely unhackable, everyone's tokens are going to the MOOOON! Everyone's but mine, that is. How about this: if you can get my TTMCOIN's price high enough, I'll give you the flag. That sound fair?
Required Note 1: This chall has to be solved in remix - https://remix.ethereum.org/, using the first address shown(0x5b3...eddc4)
Required Note 2: The final flag is the transaction hash from calling the solve() function(as a string) XORed with 575105531e4f120e1c6d115d5d126d5d4e3a43590f59074439425a525616515f5b4e4c5b000057434d475b416f4e5b57473c0848694158095b56173b170a5d51(as hex)
Required Note 3: The flag "repeats" in the output you get, but it should be clear what to submit. If not, please open a ticket.
Note 4: If the output isn't wrapped in n00bz{...}. you may need to reload the page, and solve the chall in as few steps as possible. If it still isn't working but you have a solution, we'll give you the flag.
Ex: If you get 0x7bff as the hash, you should xor "7bff"(as a string) with 575105531e4f120e1c6d115d5d126d5d4e3a43590f59074439425a525616515f5b4e4c5b000057434d475b416f4e5b57473c0848694158095b56173b170a5d51(as hex). The output will already be wrapped in n00bz{...}
