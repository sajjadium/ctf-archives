You have woken up with sand underneath your back, you hear the ocean WAVs and smell the salty water, and looking straight above is the bright blue sky. Your memory is a bit groggy but you have a recollection of how you got here, a bad boating accident. You feel around in your pocket and there is a paper titled Shadows of the Digital Abyss with some weird story on it. As you are reading through that paper you hear the ocean WAVs beating against the sand dunes ahead. You notice something in the sand and you go to investigate but it's just a glass bottle. In that bottle is a rolled up piece of paper, with literally gibberish. Just all letters and numbers! This seems like a treasure hunt, or possibly even a fever dream.
