    I'm not gonna lie. With all of the information I'm absorbing, I'm about to lose my mind. It's times like these that I understand how someone could go crazy like Mr. 4-sided-earth himself. Okay, maybe not as crazy as him, but you get the idea.
    Speaking of - I really do wonder how he got obssessed with cubes.
    Simon got an interview with him the other day where it seems like it wasn't just about cubes...
    Ray mentioned writing it down, but I thought he only wrote the blog.
    I guess I'm wrong. Mind finding it for me? Stick to the federal stuff, please - Ray didn't trust the Googles.
    When you find it, tell me what he was doing business as when he published the book, the page count, and the alpha-numberic registration id.
