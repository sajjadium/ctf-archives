misc hard

Your neighbors down the block own a small retail business that is taking off! Their sales are doing great, their customers are happy and employment is stable too. A random afternoon you get a call from them saying they think they were hacked (OH NO)! As the well known, and super knowledgeable cyber security specialist you are, you run down to try to help them remediate the problem ASAP. You notice that there is some sort of malware on the accounting computer, that is asking for encryption authentication. You need to figure out the code to get in there and find that flag! One piece of evidence was found in the network on one of the servers, check the network and see what you can find, the more time they have on there, the more they can take for ransom!

Flag Format (all uppercase): jctf{FLAG1_FLAG2_FLAG3}
