misc easy

Artificial intelligence makes me shiver. How could anyone ever try to outsmart something that can read you in a million ways? Maybe it's not about how much you can see, but what you choose to see. Like in the alien hunters in the Predator movie, it only needed a handful of filters before it saw what it needed to see out in the Open. Even then it's not enough to Solve it. Hidden in plain sight. Hidden in the little bits.
