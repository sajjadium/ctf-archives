Our informant has met back with us at base. He has stolen a file from a suspect who’s starting to show dangerous signs of cyberpsychosis. Aside from his unending lust for bloodshed, our informant noted that the suspect would not shut up about “rats making him crazy” as well as the term “Base FFFF+1” but that’s probably just nonsense. Anyways, can you look beyond the layers of this corrupted file to extract the information that we need?
