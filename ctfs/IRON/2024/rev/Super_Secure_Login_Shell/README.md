So, I had to make this commandline login interface for work. They had me go through these docs about access tokens and what not. To be honest, web technology flies right above my head. So, I decided go with something existing that everyone understands!! I don't get all the fuss about security. Like look, the current setup gets the job done, what else do you want??
Anyways, here's a prototype of the interface I wrote in Python (coz coding is hard). Don't worry about the other file, apparently "security" is a "BIG" concern, so I tinkered around a little bit to make my solution secure.
There's a flag behind the login and obviously I'm not gonna give you the creds. I just need you to help me prove everyone wrong about the so called "risks" of using a "homebrewed" solution.
