Dantzig was on a trip with his friends and one day, they decided to play a game or atleast, it's easier version. He would think of a string and the others have to find it based on the clues he gives them.

1. The knapsack list contains 8 numbers, with 1 and 2 as the first two numbers and the subsequent numbers are formed by adding one to the sum of all the numbers before.
2. The value of m=257 and n is something less than 257
3. The encrypted string is - [538, 619, 944, 831, 360, 531, 468, 971, 635, 593, 655, 425, 1068, 530, 1068, 360, 706, 1068, 299, 619, 670, 1068, 891, 425, 670, 1068, 371, 670, 732, 531, 1068, 484, 372, 635, 371, 372, 237, 237, 1007]

Can you find the string Dantzig was thinking of?
