A few years back, a colleague of ours joined the company and uploaded some secure Rust code to the repository. Unfortunately, the repository has since been deleted, leaving us with only the executable file. The issue we're facing now is that the binary isn't functioning properly. Could you assist us in extracting the flag from the executable?
