Kenji is a nice guy who lives in Tokyo. He is in a dilemma. In 2017, he was late to an important meeting and is now facing repercussions. To defend himself, he needs to prove that it was not his fault. His evidence? The train he boarded that day, traveling between Omotesando and Suitengumae, was delayed. However, his boss is not providing the specific details of the accusation. Kenji vividly remembers one key fact: the train was around 61 minutes late.

Help him uncover the exact date of the incident and the start time of the delay. Justice for Kenji!
