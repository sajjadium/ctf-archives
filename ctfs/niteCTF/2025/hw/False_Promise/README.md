A defense contractor has submitted a secure authentication module for your agency's procurement consideration. Their proposal includes an internal code review report claiming the implementation demonstrates resistance to side-channel attacks and is suitable for classified applications. Before the agency can approve this system for deployment, independent verification is required. Your intelligence division has obtained the contractor's internal code review report and the complete power trace dataset used during their evaluation. As the agency's lead hardware security analyst, you are tasked with conducting an independent test of the authentication module. Your objective is to recover the 20-character password from the provided artifacts.
Example: nite{extracted_password}
