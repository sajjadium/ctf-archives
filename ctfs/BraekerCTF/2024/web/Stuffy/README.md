A screen shows a document labeled Optimal_human_interaction_design.ppt. "What's that design about?" you ask.
The bot replies "It is called 'social media': We'll have everyone send messages to each other on a public forum, with messages no longer than 200 characters. This will force them to think deep and write convincing arguments with as little words as possible, to prevent humans from acting pompous, egoistic or conceited."

Do you see any way this can go wrong?
