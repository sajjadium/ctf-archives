You encounter a bot meditating in the park. He opens his cameras and begins to speak.

"Hear the word of RNGesus. Complexity is the enemy of security. Let your encryption be as simple as possible, as to secure it, thusly". He hands you a flyer with a snippet of code. "Secure every message you have with it. Only those who see can enter."

What do you think? Is it simple enough to be secure?
