A creaky old bot is zooming in and out of an eye chart. "Can you read the bottom line?" the doctor asks. "No way, " the bot replies. "At a certain distance my view becomes convoluted. Here, I'll make a screenshot."

You and the doctor look at the screenshot. Can you tell what's wrong with the bot's visual processor?
