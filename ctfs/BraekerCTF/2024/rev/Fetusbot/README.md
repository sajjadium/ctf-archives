Our android mother has reached her third trimester, where she started to experience some pain in the right lower back. Before the doctor advises pelvic tilt exercises, you get called on the job for a procedural check on the fetus's programming.

In the code, you see that the fetus is indeed requesting input, but it also seems to have developed a protective mechanism to prevent execution of your data!
Can you hack the fetus and her mother back to health?
