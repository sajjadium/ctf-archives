A friend of mine found many XSS bugs in his bug hunting, one day I asked him how he found this much vulnerabilities, then he presented me his tool, and gave access to it.

I just need to give a domain name in the dashboard, his tool fuzzes the web application and finds the XSS vulnerabilities in that domain, he said that he use headless chrome under the hood.

You can access his website using the below link and find more XSS, however it's still in development so the FUZZing wordlist is small.
