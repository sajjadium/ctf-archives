During the Fourth Great Cyber War, an unknown entity—rumored to be from the Uchiha clan—is transmitting a cryptic serial signal. You, a member of the opposing faction, have intercepted the transmission. However, it’s fragmented, encoded at different speeds, and appears to be hiding something within the noise.

The signal’s structure resembles Madara Uchiha’s words before unleashing the Infinite Tsukuyomi—but there’s more to it. Could this be the key to unlocking the truth?

Decrypt the signal before you fall into an illusion. Reality or Genjutsu—only your skills will tell.
