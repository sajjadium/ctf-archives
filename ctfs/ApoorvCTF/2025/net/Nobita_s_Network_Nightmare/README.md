Nobita was given a simple task: update the company’s internal network drive. It stored important files that everyone needed. He didn’t understand much about networks, but he wanted to prove he could handle it.

Without checking the instructions, he pressed a few buttons and messed the network up. The shared ftp drive disappeared. Within minutes, employees started complaining.

Gian and Suneo, who relied on the files, stormed into the IT room. “What did you do?” they demanded. Nobita panicked and called Dekisugi.

Help Dekisugi fix the network!
