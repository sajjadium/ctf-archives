Hey everyone, I have a friend Sakura. She wanted to learn how programming works so I gave her the best advice anyone could have given her- participate in ApoorvCTF.
She's trying her best to find flags and could only find the welcome flag, sending /flag XD.
If you consider yourself real OSINTers — stalk her.
