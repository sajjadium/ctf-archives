We were digging through the old archives and we found the following email, maybe you can make sense of it? It came with two attachments.

TO:       CuriousCultist@bigpond.com
FROM:     XXXXDYNi103@bestEditor.net
SUBJECT:  RE: Recruitment... Final Test

Dear CC,

Congratulations on making it this far, however, as I'm sure
you're aware, we have to be careful about usurpers and bad
faith actors infiltrating the fold.

Attached is your final test, use your knowledge to extract
the password and reply to this email with it. We look
forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
    ..........
