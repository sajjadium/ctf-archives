The Ministry of Australian Research into Yaks (MARY) is the leading authority of yak related research in Australia. They know a lot about long-haired domesticated cattle, but unfortunately not a lot about information security.

They have been migrating their yak catalog application to a serverless, lambda based, architecture in AWS, but in the process have accidentally exposed an access key used by their admins. You've gotten a hold of this key, now use this access to uncover MARY's secrets!
