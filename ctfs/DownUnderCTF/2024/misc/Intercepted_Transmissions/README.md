Those monsters! They've kidnapped the Quokkas! Who in their right mind would capture those friendly little guys.. We've managed to intercept a CCIR476 transmission from the kidnappers, we think it contains the location of our friends! Can you help us decode it? We managed to decode the first two characters as '##'

NOTE: Wrap the decoded message in DUCTF{}.
