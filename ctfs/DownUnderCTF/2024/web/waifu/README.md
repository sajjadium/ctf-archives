medium #waifu

The big bad bot got a bit lonely after a hard day of work and made a Web Artificial Intelligence Firewall Utiliy (WAIFU) to talk with and block hacking attempts.

Can you bypass the bot's WAIFU?

Important Note

    Use 127.0.0.1 (not localhost) instead of container names (the ports the services are listening on are the same).
