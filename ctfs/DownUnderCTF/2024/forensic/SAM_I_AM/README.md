The attacker managed to gain Domain Admin on our rebels Domain Controller! Looks like they managed to log on with an account using WMI and dumped some files.

Can you reproduce how they got the Administrator's Password with the artifacts provided?

Place the Administrator Account's Password in DUCTF{}, e.g. DUCTF{password123!}
