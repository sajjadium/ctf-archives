You have been found by the OCBC (Office central de lutte contre le trafic des biens culturels - Central Office for Combating Trafficking in Cultural Property). To guarantee your freedom, you must cooperate : if you manage to provide all the information relating to the investigation, no charges will be brought against you.

Initially, you will be asked to scout the Louvre in order to understand how the museum is structured and to obtain crucial information. Your mission is to collect the following data :

    Number of glass panels that make up the Louvre pyramid
    Month the Louvre was inaugurated
    Total surface area of the Louvre (in m2)
    Name of the oldest work exhibited in the Louvre

This information is essential for the current survey. Once you have collected this data, you will need to compile it into a flag in the following format : DVCTF{number-of-panels_month_total-area_piece-name}

For example, if you found : 100 panels, july, 1000 m2, and La Joconde, the flag would be : DVCTF{100_july_1000_la-joconde}.
