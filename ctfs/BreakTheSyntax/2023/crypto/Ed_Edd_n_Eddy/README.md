The Eds have implemented a signature scheme system in order to know who writes what in the neighbourhood. The only problem is that now no one believes messages that are not signed! Help Ed convince Eddy to carry out his master plan, without Double D realising who is the author of the message.

Note: Eddy uses OpenSSl-based implementation of Ed448, while Edd uses WolfSSL-based implementation. Challenge inspired by AC research.
