My friend told me that yesterday she received a document from a colleague, then her computer received a new windows update from Microsoft. After updating Windows to the new version, while surfing the web, she suddenly realized that she had been attacked by ransomware, all her important files were encrypted. She panicked and deleted all her documents. With your digital forensic skills, please investigate whether all the encrypted files have been stolen or not! And can you help her recover the data?
