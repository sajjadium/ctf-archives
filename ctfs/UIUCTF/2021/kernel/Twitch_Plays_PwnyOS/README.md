I'm thinking of a prime number between 8900 and 9100...

There's a syscall with that number, fuzz the syscalls and discover it to receive a flag.

When you call the correct syscall, the flag will be printed to the screen, and you will need to press enter to reboot.

This VM will reboot once every hour regardless of interaction.
