I want to check if any of my passwords have been stolen, but I don't want to risk sending them to Have I Been Pwned. I want a stronger guarantee than the k-anonymity that they provide. You can help me by submitting any leaked passwords you may find to a private set intersection protocol.

Usage: ./psi_sender.py password1234 notthepassword fall2021
