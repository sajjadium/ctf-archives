FizzBuzz101, anematode

For three years in a row, you have quacked the anti-quack system developed by the ducks at the local pond. A former outcast duck has recently returned, one who has been enlightened by Church based computing over traditional Turing based computing. After a decade of locking in on lambda quackulus, this duck has spread its functional programming mind virus to the rest of the pond. Now, they have devised the "purest" crackme, one built from a single combinator - can you quack it now?

Note that the flag must be wrapped in the flag format for submission.
