Hello. I'm the world's best programmer. If you're reading this, it's either fate
or you opened the wrong disk. Either way: welcome.

I build scalable systems, write poetry in assembly and I once fixed a null pointer with a hug.

Passwords? Not my problem — for years my master key was the elegant and
uncomplicated **1234**. It unlocked everything: my dotfiles, ancient vim themes,
my collection of cursed stickers, and that tiny vault where I stash "programmer
treasures" (nostalgic config files, terrible pasta recipes, and the occasional
ASCII art relic).

Lately there have been weird logins from suspicious places (someone keeps trying to SSH from the basement of a mole).  
So I did what any responsible, extremely humble genius would do: I wrote the single greatest password generator the world has ever seen — `generator.py`.  
I ran it. I trusted it. I thought the future was safe.

Now I can't get into my own vault. The script spat out a new password and then I panicked. 
If you find this disk and you get the password, please don't sell my pasta recipe to the highest bidder.

Good luck, have fun, and if you find the password: no refunds.  
— The Best Programmer (probably)
