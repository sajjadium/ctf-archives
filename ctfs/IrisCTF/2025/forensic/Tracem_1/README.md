Here at EI Corp, ethics are our top priority! That's why our IT team was shocked when we got a knock from our ISP informing us that someone on our computer network was involved in some illegitimate activity. Who would do that? Don't they know that's illegal?

Our ISP's knocking (and so is HR), and we need someone to hold accountable. Can you find out who committed this violation?
