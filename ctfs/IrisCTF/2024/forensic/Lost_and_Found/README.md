I found this ID card on the ground near some train tracks. It's a bit dirty, and the card is all scratched up! I took some pictures before and after a light brushing, and I'd like to find the owner. Can you find out who it belongs to?

Note: this is not an OSINT challenge. The flag format is irisctf{firstname_lastname}. The flag is not case sensitive.
