I just got around to starting up my own forensics team. We're calling our selves the Burger King Crackers for our exceptional skills at getting information out of encrypted systems left by cyber criminals. Our first big case has finally arrived but there is just one file we can't seem to solve. The cyber criminals left over this encrypted zip file containing their plans. We were able to recover the first part of a file, but thats it. Can you recover their evil plans?
