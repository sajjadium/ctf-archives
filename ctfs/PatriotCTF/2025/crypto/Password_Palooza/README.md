We were infiltrating a hacker's network to bring down their team, but we've run into a slight issue. We managed to find the manager's password hash, and through some OSINT efforts we discovered that their password was leaked in a popular password breach.

Their password also has two random digits following whatever password was leaked. An example would be password13.

Can you crack their password?

Hash: 3a52fc83037bd2cb81c5a04e49c048a2

The flag format will be pctf{password}
