The spirits of chaos have encrypted a secret message, but they're capricious and demand perfect entropy to reveal it. This binary reads [REDACTED], transforms it through [REDACED] , and only decrypts the flag if the transformation produces exactly [REDACTED]. The catch? The [REDACTED] must be just right, and the spirits are watching. Maybe they will [REDACTED] your data if they see any [REDACTED] lurking in the [REDACTED]. Can you tame the chaos and coax the correct [REDACTED] from [REDACTED] to reveal the flag?

Flag may have characters such as underscores, asterisks, dashes, or parathensis in it.
