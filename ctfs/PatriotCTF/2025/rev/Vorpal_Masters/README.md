I'm excited to announce the launch of my brand new video game Vorpal Masters. In light of recent pirating attacks, I've implemented a copy protection by requiring a license key when you launch the game. Before I publish the game to Steam, I just want to have someone test it to make sure it's as uncrackable as I think it is.

The flag is the license key, put into the format CACI{Key}
