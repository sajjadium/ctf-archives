I lost it all in one bad tick—
my feline Vault, gone *way* too quick.
A virus on my janky ’puter
went boom and turned my cats to neuter.

I had so many cats in store,
but one’s the one my heart longs for.
If I could see that pic again,
my nine lives might come back to ten.

For “maximum security” flair,
I hashed each cat with loving care.
Couldn’t back up the pics themselves—
the feds would sniff them off my shelves.

So now I search through bits and trash
for just one sacred, purring stash.
If you can find that photo, friend,
my broken heart might almost mend. <3
