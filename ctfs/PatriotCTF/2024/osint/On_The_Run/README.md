We've been tracking the adversary for weeks, and he just slipped up and posted this gorgeous high-rise view on his Twitter. His caption was "awesome meeting with a gorgeous view!" Can you track down his location?

Flag format will be PCTF{<business name of his location>}. Not a street address. If he were in a WeWork space, it would be PCTF{wework}.
