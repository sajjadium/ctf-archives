An overseas branch of our company was almost hit by an attack from a well-known ransomeware group, but it seemed their final payload failed. We found a suspicious drive on premises, as well as a common string in our logs: PCTF{d)zn+d$+zqbb!t+h)!#+if+y)u+zi!l}. Can you help us figure out what this payload might have been?
