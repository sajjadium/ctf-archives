You’ve hacked into a mysterious system, only to find yourself inside a virtual machine, within another virtual machine, like stepping into a never-ending hall of mirrors. The first VM interprets the encrypted bytecode, but every instruction gets passed to a deeper layer. As you explore further, each action plunges you deeper into the abyss, where time and logic twist in ways you've never imagined.

Will you escape the infinite virtual prison or succumb to its endless loops? The only way out is through... all the layers.
