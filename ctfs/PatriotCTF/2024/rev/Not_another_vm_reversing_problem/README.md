You find yourself locked out of a mysterious terminal in an underground lair that’s rumored to hold the key to a treasure of unimaginable value: the flag. The terminal is powered by an ancient, quirky virtual machine that hasn't been updated since the days of dial-up internet. Your task is simple... on the surface.

This VM is no ordinary one. It’s got an arcane stack-based architecture, four registers that feel like they've seen better days, and 16KB of memory that’s probably still running on hopes and dreams. But here’s the twist: the terminal was built by a paranoid genius who coded a secret message—hidden deep within the memory—wrapped in layers of logic more convoluted than the plot of a sci-fi novel.
