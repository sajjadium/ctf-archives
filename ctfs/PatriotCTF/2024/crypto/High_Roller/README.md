We recieved word that a criminal APT had developed their own method for generating secure asymmetric encryption keys. We were able to intercept emails between the group including encrypted comms, and a 7zip file. All we managed to find in the 7zip file they sent out was their public key, and the key generator. Can you decrypt the comms?
