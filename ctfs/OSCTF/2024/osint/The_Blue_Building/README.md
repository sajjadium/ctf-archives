OSINT

Can you see the blue building over there?

It seems to have a name, but I used an image editing app to make it more challenging.

Try to find the coordinates close to where I took this photo.

(The last two digits of the coordinates are both odd.)

Example: OSCTF{67.235, 23.679}

Note: That blue building and the structure behind me are quite large.
