Otto and his brothers discover that his friend Siegfried has written a love letter to the girl of his dreams. When he opened it, it was a very cheesy letter, but part of it was encrypted and couldn't be read. And then hearing about the experts at the OSCTF tournament who could decode all codes, he immediately brought the letter to ask you to see it. Don't put the plaintext in flag format.

Ex: the output is HELLO_WORLD, then the flag is OSCTF{HELLO_WORLD}
