This challenge contains 4 handouts:

- README: This file.
- chal_build: The files used to build the challenge. You can use this to build
  another copy of the challenge but the binary layout is not guaranteed to
  remain the same.
- edk2_artifacts: EDK2 OVMF build artifacts containing debugging symbols of
  each UEFI module.
- run: Pre-built files in case you want to run the challenge locally. This is
  the same copy of the challenge running on the server.

I also bundled gcc per popular request from 2022. Apologies for the
size of the handle bundle. The disk contains kernel module headers in
/usr/src/linux-headers and you may build modules from within.

The static build of QEMU in run is built with debug symbols on.
