Warning: Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It is possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members that have absolute filenames starting with "/" or filenames with two dots "..". https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.extractall
I'm aware this warning but didn't know what to do right. Is this okay?
