I plugged in a USB and it encrypted my files. Luckily I had the initiative to take an image of the USB after the encryption occurred (fiilllleeeeeeee.ad1). Can you find a way of decrypting my most important file (flag.txt)?

Note: The ransomware in the image should be harmless as it only targets a specific directory that is incredibly unlikely to exist by chance.

The .zip password is fiilllleeeeeeee.
