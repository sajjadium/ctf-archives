Welcome to the Shellcode Game, polyglot edition. Do you have what it takes to win the game? This challenge is probably harder than x64 edition even though it has fewer levels. Solving x64 edition may get you acquainted with the format but the skills you learn won't help you here. Good luck!

(Handout is identical to x64 edition)
