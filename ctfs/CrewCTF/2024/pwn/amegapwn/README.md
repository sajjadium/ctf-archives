FlagSafe version 2.3, now with Secure Erase Technology!(patent pending) By using our multi-erase technology we are able to erase your data more thoroughly than ever before! Flag encryptor functionality is unchanged from version 2.2.

Remote is very slow, test your code locally first! To get consistent results, send your exploit in one go, do NOT wait for the application to start. As soon as a delay is introduced the simulation becomes non-deterministic.
