the fremen are trying to sabotage the spice harvest and they need your help! spice harvesters have worm image recognition technology to know when to avoid a worm attack. luckily for you, a hacker genius got access to the pixels of the worm image, but you can only change up to 30 pixels of it. can you help the fremen destroy a spice harvester?

NOTE: the model is the same as the worm strikes back
