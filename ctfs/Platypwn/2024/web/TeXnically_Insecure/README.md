Note: It may be a good idea to test your exploit locally first. However, if you manage to break the challenge, simply restart it.

After starting my studies, I wanted to play around with LaTeX. So I built a web-based editor! Unfortunately, people have tried hacking it, so I needed to blacklist some commands. But I’m sure it’s 100% secure now! :) I also made the app restart if it crashes, I just hope that people can’t abuse that for something. But hey, it’s just a restart, right? What could possibly go wrong?
