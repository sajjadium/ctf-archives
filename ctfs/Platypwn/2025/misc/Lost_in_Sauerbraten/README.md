A maze you say? Hold my Spezi! Solve our custom maze map by finding the hidden flags and prove you are a worthy Sauerbraten player!

To connect to the server build the custom Sauerbraten client from the provided Dockerfile in the challenge files. We have added some useful stuff to load our custom map and to make connecting easier. We also have upgraded our Sauerbraten server to extend functionality and prevent cheating! (This might result in you getting kicked from the server)

Have fun playing some Sauerbraten!
