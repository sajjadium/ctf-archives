The challenge author has found a nice ditch, so they took a photo of it including the signpost with its coordinates on. But what is that! A Platypwny has eaten up the coordinates!

Luckily, you can still find the coordinates again, right?

Brute force is neither necessary nor allowed to solve this challenge. Do not attack the location picker tool. The tool is rate-limited to three tries per minute, so be careful when you submit. A full-resolution version of the image is available for download. This is not a forensics challenge.

A nice ditch.
