Briefing: Agent: Agent P (a.k.a. Perry the Platypus) Subject: Recovered backup — suspected to belong to Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz Objective: Extract and analyze critical intelligence fragments before they self-destruct (metaphorically, we hope).

During a recent OWCA operation, Agent P recovered a backup from a damaged device belonging to Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. The phone itself is beyond repair, but traces of data remain. Analysis suggests Doofenshmirtz intentionally scattered three hidden fragments across different parts of his system. His final voice memo offers only riddles — a frozen memory, a restless idea, and in resting thoughts. Your task: extract all fragments before whatever he was planning comes to life.
