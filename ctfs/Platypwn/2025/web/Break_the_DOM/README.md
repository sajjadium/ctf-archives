Note: this challenge may take up to two minutes to deploy.

You have been studying for this moment for the past three months: the final contest of the competitive programming lecture at your university is scheduled to start in three days. However, to your dismay, the integrity of the contest seems to have been damaged: a fellow student already has access to the problem statements and has been working on their solutions ahead of time! You know the teaching team and you trust that they didn’t share the problems, so the only fragile component is the platform the competition is hosted on: DOMJudge.

Of course, being a competitive programmer, you need to win this competition. And for this, you too need access to the problem statements – ASAP! Luckily, the DOMJudge config is available on the chairs GitLab, so you’ll only need to find a way in.

Did the admins mess up the setup, or is there a problem with the platform itself?
