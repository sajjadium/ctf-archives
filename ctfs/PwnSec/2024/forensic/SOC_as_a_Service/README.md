Recently, our SOC experienced unusual inbound and outbound connections. We suspect that one of our analysts might have made a significant mistake. After conducting an investigation, we discovered that an analyst received an email. He told us he started investigating the email as a normal day and a normal ticket, but after it, some malicious activity occurred. Could you assist us in investigating what went wrong and identify our analyst's mistake?
