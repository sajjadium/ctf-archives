Our Security Operations Center (SOC) has flagged a suspicious event. An employee reported receiving a seemingly benign Excel spreadsheet, and shortly after, our network intrusion detection system (IDS) logged unusual outbound traffic from their workstation. We fear this was a multi-stage attack culminating in data theft. We have successfully captured the full packet capture from the suspected timeframe and have also recovered the initial lure file. Your task is to perform a full analysis of these two artifacts. You must reconstruct the attack chain, uncover the attacker's methodology, and ultimately determine what data was exfiltrated.
