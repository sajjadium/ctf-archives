Your friend wanted to learn malware analysis and downloaded a cracked version of IDA Pro from the internet. At first, everything seemed fine — until Facebook sent a warning about a suspicious login.

He started getting suspicious and asked you to take a look at the file he downloaded — still sitting in his Downloads folder.

Can you find the domain where the attacker exfiltrated the data to?

Format flag: Blitz{domain} For exmaple, if domain is domain.com, so flag is: Blitz{domain.com} https://files.sakamoto.moe/9a2427d7238c_Download.zip

password: infected
