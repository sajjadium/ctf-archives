Background Story
During a red team exercise, Loki the Trickster successfully compromised Thor’s machine and planted a backdoor. Thor discovered the anomaly and identified Loki’s C2 server IP, but as a script kiddie, he only knows how to run directory scanners and has no idea how to counterattack.
In desperation, Thor captured all the network traffic and came to you for help. The AllFather Odin watches from his throne, curious to see if you possess the wisdom to unravel Loki’s schemes.
“In the halls of Asgard, deception wears many faces. Even Huginn and Muninn, Odin’s ravens, struggle to discern truth from illusion when Loki weaves his tricks.”
