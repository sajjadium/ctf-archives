Out here in the dusty frontier, word travels fast - and rumor has it some greenhorn done left their Redis instance ridin' solo out in the open prairie... no sheriff, no fence, not even a tumbleweed in sight. || Now, in these parts, exposin' a Redis server to the wild’s as dangerous as leavin' the saloon doors open with the gold sittin' on the counter. What could go wrong, you ask? Maybe nothin'... or maybe some outlaw with a keen eye and quick fingers might just mosey on in and rustle up more than their fair share. || Reckon you've got what it takes to poke around and show 'em what happens when you forget to lock the barn after the horses bolt? || We will reveal our exploit script once the intended vulnerability is patched and disclosed by Redis. Proof of exploit: https://x.com/0x10n/status/1907686860811276607 - f0b22e429fa6c984f39a409744ff954d3a45d843edd29428ef3a68085d696a7d.
