I secretly installed tracking software on a virtual reality headset before selling it to a known rebel spy. Before handing it over, I made sure to record myself typing on a virtual keyboard (and my tracking software captured it all!).

Later, I recovered the spy's usage data. Im confident they typed the flag. Use the data to recover their message and help me squash this rebellion once and for all!

hints> -Single spaces represent underscores and double spaces represent braces in the flag. -The virtual keyboard appears 2 units in front of the controller, along the controllers forward z axis. -Be warned: the user's perspective may differ between sessions.
