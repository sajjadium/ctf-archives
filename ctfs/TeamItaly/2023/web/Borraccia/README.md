I introduce to you Borraccia!
Borraccia is a minimal web framework which puts security first. Are you asking how he does it? Well, by removing (almost) all the features that I consider useless. Obviously it's written in Python, so it's 100% safe!
Note: You are limited to 60 requests per minute. It's recommended to test it locally first.
