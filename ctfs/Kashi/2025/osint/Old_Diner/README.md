My friend once visited this place that served ice cream with coke. He said he had the best Greek omlette of his life and called it a very american experience. Can you find the name of the diner and the amount he paid?

Flag Format: KashiCTF{Name_of_Diner_Amount}

For clarification on the flag format The diner's name is in title case with spaces replaced by underscores. The amount is without currency sign, and in decimal, correct to two decimal places, i.e. KashiCTF{Full_Diner_Name_XX.XX}
