ScourgeXV

Did you know the cosmic weapons like this? I found similar example of such weapons on the net and it was even weirder. This ruler's court artist once drew the most accurate painting of a now extinct bird. Can you tell me the coordinates upto 4 decimal places of the place where this painting is right now.
