I have received a crash report from my server service and I lost my access to the server. The initial analysis suggests a failed binary exploitation attempt caused the crash. Help me to get access back to my server. The Dockerfile will give you an environment identical to the server, you need to use it to analyze the core dump of the exploited process and to reproduce the exploit.
