Pwn, difficulty:Hard

Lyrics: RIPTC
Composer: Krias aka Digging into kernel

I'm fond of the days that are retro
Hate the future's unpredictable echo
Peep into the kernel, take a look
Revive the code that the attack took
Found one new 0 day, what a magic
Triggering the moment, I've lost the knack
Patching up the class, secrets I pack

Source code added a few files, ain't no pretense
Three characters added in another file, spotted only in vmlinux, no defense

Friends from afar, they arrive
Could you help me thrive, like eating greens, time
