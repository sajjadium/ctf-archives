Misc, Crypto, difficulty:Baby

You are right, but "CTF" originated from the DEFCON global hacker conference in 1996. It is a competitive game among network security enthusiasts. This game takes place in a competition called "RealWorld", where those who solve the challenge will be awarded a "Flag". You will play a character named "CTFer" and work with your teammates in the game, using knowledge and skills to solve various challenges - and at the same time, gradually discover the truth of "Plain".
