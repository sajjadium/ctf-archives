You are a human spy sent to gather information on a new centralized computing station that the Reptilians have developed, and is being used to house important secrets. In order to blend in, you learned the Reptilian language, which is similar to English except there are no spaces and you can't talk for too long.

Using your unique skillset, gather as much information from the Reptilians as you can. If you can tell us how they started the server we can replicate it ourselves. There may be a flag in it for you if you do.

The flag will be in the standard format for SwampCTF.
