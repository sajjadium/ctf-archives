You have to make 100 cupcakes for your upcoming end of year party and you only have 3 hours to do so after oversleeping the night before. However you are in luck because ShopRite just released their Magic Flour that makes any sort of batter immediately. In order to get the Magic Flour you have to solve a puzzle where you decode the message "avxmsvyusbyxj" using the key word SIFT. Time is ticking!
Note: wrap the result you get in the flag format in all lowercase, eg. flag{example}
