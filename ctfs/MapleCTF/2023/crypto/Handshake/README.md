In a world where distance often reigns, There lies a gesture that breaks all chains. A simple act, though brief it stands, The gentle meeting of two hands. With fingers clasped in tender grip, A silent oath from lip to lip. In the warm embrace of palm to palm, There breathes a universal calm.

Amid the storms that time commands, We find our anchor in shaking hands. It sows the seeds of friendship's lands, A bridge that spans all life's expanses. In this brief touch, love understands, The boundless power of shaking hands. An age-old dance, life’s sweetest strands, Bound together, in shaking hands.
