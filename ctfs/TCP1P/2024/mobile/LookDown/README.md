Hi guys, i just make my second Mobile app, can you check it?

The infrastructure being used is based on our Mobile POC Tester (https://github.com/TCP1P/Mobile-POC-Tester). You will need to create your exploit application that will be executed in the server. You can check client_dist.py for more information on how the automation for this challenge runs.
