After reading this article, I'm now hesitant to use xz-utils for compression: https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4 As a result, I've been searching for alternative compression tools. I found one online, but unfortunately this tools are trash because it has limited features. Specifically, I’m unable to decompress files that were compressed with a password. Could you please help me recover them?
