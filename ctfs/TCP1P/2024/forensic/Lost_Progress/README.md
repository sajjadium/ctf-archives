My friend Andi just crashed his computer and all the progress he made are gone. It was 2 of his secret passwords with each of them being inside an image and a text file. Luckily he has an automatic RAM capture program incase something like this happen, but no idea on how to use it...

Format: TCP1P{imagepassword_textfilepassword}
