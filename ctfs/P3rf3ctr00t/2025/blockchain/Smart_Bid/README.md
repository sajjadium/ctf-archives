What is blockchain, but have you ever interfaced with it? Now's your lucky day to get a crash course!

I have provided a blockchain/web3 contract written in Solidity. You are also provided with a website endpoint. The site gives you a nice interface to spin up an instance of blockchain infrastructure for you (and only you!). In order to gain access to your own infra, you need to first solve a Proof of Work (bottom left box). You can either run the provided command in the terminal, or press "Solve in Browser". Put the solution in the "Solution" box, and when you submit it, it will allow you to spawn an instance using "Launch".
