Long ago in Nidavellir, where molten rivers fuel the dwarven forges, the craftsmen built a strange device for Thor himself.

It was meant to test cunning rather than strength — an ancient terminal called the Echo Forge.

The rules are simple and deceptive.

Whatever command a traveller enters is immediately echoed back, unaltered and unfiltered, by the ancient mechanism.

The Echo Forge is stubborn, literal, and unforgiving.

Only a subtle approach will pierce its defences.
