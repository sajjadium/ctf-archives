Dr. Eleanor Riggs is a research scientist at Riggs Labs and the creator of MIKE. MIKE was an ambitious project with an aim to develop a fully autonomous intelligent agent with pseudo-infinite capabilities. Recently, Dr. Riggs started noticing strange behaviors on MIKE's networks. Due to fear of MIKE going rogue, Dr. Riggs started monitoring MIKE's networks and made attempts to get access to MIKE's neurotic layers and curb MIKE. But MIKE, possibly aware of her intentions, went off the grid. The only thing left behind is a network packet capture as recorded by Dr.Riggs. Help access MIKE's core neural components and the flag will be yours.
