High upon the emerald hills of Eldara stood a fort, its golden walls gleaming in the sunlight. The fort, known as Celestia, had watched over the land for centuries, nestled between towering peaks and rolling valleys. It was said that the fort was built not for war, but to embrace the beauty of the world around it. From its highest tower, one could see endless horizons—rivers sparkling like silver threads, forests swaying in the wind, the sun setting in a blaze of orange and pink, casting a warm glow over the hills and the flags of different countries making them easy to capture. An Italian mathematician from the 1200s unveiled a revolutionary weapon and a KEY, providing a pathway that would empower them to conquer the world. However, the journey would reset after every 8th step.

Can you find the weapon?
