Yeahh, explorers! You’ve come so far, proving your strength and resolve time and time again. I know you’re tired, but now is not the time to rest. We’ve escaped the enemy’s planet, but they won’t let us go easily. They are right on our tail, firing relentlessly, determined to stop us. Blasts of energy shake our ship, and the tension rises. The Force is no longer strong enough to hold them back—we’ve grown weak, and the enemy grows stronger by the minute.

But we have one chance to escape: Light Speed. With it, we can outrun their fleet and disappear into the stars. The problem? We don’t know the password to engage the Light Speed drive. Without it, we’re sitting ducks in the enemy’s sights.

Your mission is clear: write the correct password to activate Light Speed and unlock our next adventure. Only with the right code will we be able to make the jump and leave the enemy behind for good.

Warrior’s Code: Once again, you must honor the warrior’s tradition. If the flag you discover is not already in the form EnXp{...flag...}, then submit it in this format: EnXp{flag}

For example, if the flag you retrieve is Imu{WillDie}, submit it as: EnXp{Imu{WillDie}}

However, if the flag is already in the correct format, such as EnXp{Imu{WillDie}}, simply submit it as is.

The galaxy awaits, explorers! Enter the password, activate Light Speed, and prepare for the next chapter in our epic journey!
