Congratulations, brave explorers! You’ve overcome great trials, and the gates of Yakin are now open! Your determination and strength have brought you this far, but the journey is not over yet. Now, we face a new challenge—one that requires cunning and skill.

To continue on our quest for the One Piece, we need battle ships to soar through the stars. The enemy's ships are mighty, but they will be ours. We must infiltrate their system and steal a battle ship to carry us forward.

But beware, explorers. The Force within you has weakened, and this task will be more difficult. Logging into the enemy’s system will require every ounce of your skill and focus. Yet, we are warriors, and no system is too strong for us to break through! Once you succeed, our adventure toward the One Piece will continue at full speed.

Warrior’s Code: As always, respect the warrior's tradition. If the flag you retrieve is not already in the form EnXp{...flag...}, submit it like this: EnXp{flag}

For example, if the flag you uncover is MilleniumFalconXGoingMerry, submit it as: EnXp{MilleniumFalconXGoingMerry}

However, if the flag is already in this format, submit it as is.

The stars await, explorers! This is your moment. Secure the ship, and let our journey to the One Piece continue!
