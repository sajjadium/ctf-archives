Explorers, we did it! Congratulations on successfully engaging the Light Speed drive. Your bravery and skill have brought us out of the enemy's grasp, and we've outrun their fleet. As we made the jump into hyperspace, the stars blurred into streaks of light, and in an instant, we left the enemy behind. The tension in the air is finally easing—our ship no longer trembles with the impact of energy blasts, and the enemy’s pursuit has ceased.

But in the chaos of the escape, we faced an unforeseen dilemma. In the rush to initiate Light Speed, we couldn’t calculate our destination in time. Now, we’re drifting through the vast unknown, far beyond the reach of any charted space. The good news? During that final, war-like sequence, something miraculous happened. As we dodged and weaved through their attacks, our countermeasures activated at just the right moment. The enemy tracking device—a tool they’d used to follow us relentlessly—was jettisoned, torn away during the final surge of Light Speed.

We are now truly untraceable, explorers. Free from their eyes, untethered from their technology. They can no longer find us in this sea of stars.

But your journey is far from over. Since you've proven yourselves worthy so far, I’m going to provide you with something extraordinary—the location of Laughtale, the legendary destination known to exist at the edge of the universe. But don’t get too excited just yet; this knowledge is locked behind a series of challenges designed to test only the most worthy explorers. If you’re not up to the task, you’ll never see it.

Here’s how you’ll find it: Your task is to crack the Pwd file and enter the pass to win.

The pass key for this file will serve as input to check.exe. Once you've found the serial of that pass key and received a positive response from check.exe, you will move to the next step.

In the next step, you'll use verify.exe, where the serial from check.exe will be your name, and the Registration number and keys are actually the secret coordinates—smartly hidden from the world. If verify.exe gives a positive response, it means the Registration number and keys are the correct coordinates.

To submit the flag, take the first half of the Registration number and the second half of the Registration key, and present it under EnXp.

For example, if the Registration number is 123 and the Registration key is 56789, your final flag will be:

EnXp{1:789}

Good luck, warrior! The path to victory awaits.
