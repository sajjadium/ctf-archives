All The Brave Explorers, Congratulations on Being a Good BOY! You’ve proven your worth, and the journey ahead is now open to you. But remember, this is just the beginning! Your strength, courage, and unyielding spirit have been recognized by the universe, and now it’s time to harness The Force within you. It is your greatest weapon, the key to defeating the enemy and reaching the One Piece.

The path to freedom from Yakin is close, but there is one more obstacle in your way. The enemy’s machine is powerful, but thanks to the Force, we’ve weakened its defenses. Now, it’s up to your skills and determination to break through and open the door of Yakin.

But be quick, brave explorers—time is not on our side. The journey is long, and even the strongest of us have limits. Your Force is strong, but you must move swiftly. Successfully logging into the enemy’s system will grant you the next piece of the puzzle and the correct flag needed to continue.

Warrior’s Code: Once again, you must honor the warrior’s tradition. If the flag you discover is not already in the form EnXp{...flag...}, then submit it in this format: EnXp{flag}

For example, if the flag you retrieve is Imu{WillDie}, submit it as: EnXp{Imu{WillDie}}

However, if the flag is already in the correct format, such as EnXp{Imu{WillDie}}, simply submit it as is.

The Force is with you, explorers! Now go, unlock the door, and press on toward your destiny.
