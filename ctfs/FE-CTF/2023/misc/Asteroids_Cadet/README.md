Ensign: I TOLD YOU, we were going to get hit by space lightning!!

You: Eh, captain, sir. It's an emergency! We... lost the navigational computer. And communications. And main propulsion.

Captain: An emergency? Come back when it's a catastrophy!

You: ...And the ice cream machine.

Captain: WHAT!? Red alert!

Captain: Set course for nearest space dock. You know, the one with dairy services.

You: Sir, that's straight through an asteroid field!
