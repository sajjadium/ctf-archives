PicoChip is a lightweight, open-sourced, portable and fast™ device for Royal standard encryption. I believe it is super secure and resistant to all sorts of attacks.

Before bringing it to production, I would like to get some feedback from the community. If you can break it I promise to ship you a PicoChip for free when it's launched.
