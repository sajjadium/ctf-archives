Someone showed me a "map" and he claimed to have found a hidden signal in it. Can you decode it?

Turn the answer to uppercase and wrap it in osu{FLAG} format.

Note: A 0 is missing in the string before decoding the flag. It is in the last third of the flag and you could notice it when you get to the part. It should be easily guessable where to add the 0. Sorry for the confusion.

expected difficulty: 3/5
