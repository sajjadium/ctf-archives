neural radiance fields are so efficient for 3d scene representation so surely a 2d temporal flow field would work great! i trained a neural net to represent my replay cursor movement. it's parameterized by time (float in seconds), x, and y coord (osu map coordinates) and it outputs (dx/dt, dy/dt) at each coordinate. can you get my replay?
