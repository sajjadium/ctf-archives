quin

I've been hardstuck for years, simply not able to rank up... so I decided to try and infiltrate the Korean offline mafia for some help. I've gotten so close, getting in contact, but now, to prove I'm part of the group, I need to prove I know every group member's ID (without giving it away over this insecure communication). The only trouble is... I don't! Can you help?
