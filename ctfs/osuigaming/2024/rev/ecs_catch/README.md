enscribe

During his sophomore year of high school, enscribe made a really bad osu!catch clone for his final project in his Exploring Computer Science class. It was his first time on Unity, but it has some charm to it!

Receive an SS (with maximum score) on "Bakamitai", the hardest map, to receive the flag. Shouldn't be too difficult, right?

Note: An SS is not enough! The remote has additional checks for specific scoring (the maximum score if SS'ed "legitimately").

Note: This executable is built for x86 Windows.
