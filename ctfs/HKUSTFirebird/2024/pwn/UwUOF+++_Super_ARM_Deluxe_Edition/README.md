After 10 people solved UwUOF++, the king of UwU once again knows your cheeky cheeky cheeky stuff! ･ิ≖ ω ≖･ิ✧

But instead of adding new stuff, the king of UwU wants to play something else. /ᐠ .ᆺ. ᐟ\ﾉ

FYI, the king of UwU bought a new MacBook Pro last year, but someone keeps saying it is not correct (啱) to use an arm-based computer... (ㆀ˘･з･˘)

As revenge, the king of UwU has changed the challenge and made it into an ARM-based challenge (=^-ω-^=)

See if you can still get the flag after all these changes (≖ᴗ≖๑)

P.S. As you guys are too strong, the king of UwU didn't provide the source code to you this time (❀╹◡╹)
