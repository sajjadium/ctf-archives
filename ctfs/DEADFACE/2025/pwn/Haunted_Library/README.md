DEADFACE appear to be using this program as a way to let potential new recruits view info on their server, while restricting access to more important files…

I tried my hand at it, but i didnt get too far before hitting a wall. I do have some discoveries that might help you, though:

1.) I dont think we’ll be able to put shellcode on the stack…

2.) getting started was a nightmare! but I found a program that makes it wayyy easier: https://github.com/io12/pwninit
