While doing some forensics on a machine over at the Night Veil University, a strange file was found. The file is a basic text file but it only contains the following binary numbers:

0011 0100
0011 0011
0010 0110
0101 0001
0001 0010
0010 0011
0100 0011
0100 0001
0011 0110
0011 0011
0001 0011
0010 0101
0100 0001
0101 0011

The team has no idea what this could possible mean…can you help them figure out the code and reveal the flag?

Submit the flag as deadface{flagtext}.
