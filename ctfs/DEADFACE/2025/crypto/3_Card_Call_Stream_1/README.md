This one is a bit weird - there was a video left behind by DEADFACE on a thumb drive. It seems strange but the short video only shows pairs of cards with the message we found in a text file being “[A-K |7-10] [0000-1111 | 0000-1111] {01000001 =QH 10D}”. We can assume its part of some instructions to solve it.
