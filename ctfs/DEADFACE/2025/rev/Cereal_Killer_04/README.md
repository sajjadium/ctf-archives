Lytton Labs has upgraded their technology after the unfortunate (for them) leak of their insecure password generator. We have managed to get our hands on a copy of the new password generator. From our initial analysis, it does appear to be secure, as it was “vibe coded” by Clippy himself, using the most advanced AI on the planet, ClippyAI.

However, whispers on the Dark Web and in the GhostTown forum lead us to believe that the program may have been tampered with, possibly by the infamous hacker / phreaker from the 90’s, Emmanuel Goldstein (Codename: CEREAL KILLER) himself!

Analyze the program and see if you can help us determine if there are any weaknesses that we can exploit, and please, as always, keep an eye out for an opportunity to exploit any information you gather.

To determine whether or not you have found a weakness, see if you can produce the password for the SHA512 hash: cc2b7d09f0a7732319328eb5dd4a1167ac34957489f384d68586a7d23909ed7654d2c3b7f50f33289aeaecf8685f0a2eb60ba269aeb448e9173fa16b6073ca14

Enter the cracked password inside of double quotes inside the flag tags, like this: deadface{"GUr$@zea#nL_yL0TB%g"}
