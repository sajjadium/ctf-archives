Eccentric billionaire business person and space-bro, Evan Must (whose tag line is the cringe-worthy “Evan MUST Get to Mars!” has decided to fund the silly endeavor of populating Mars by selling Monster Cereal NFTs!

The NFTs exist on the official Monster Cereal NFT Block Chain, which has a custom extractor program and a “seed image” of the absolutely terrifying Jason Voorhees and his signature breakfast cereal, Machete Mateys!

Evan has hidden a flag inside the blockchain, and he promises a handsome reward for the first person to extract it. We know that Lytton Labs, DEADFACE, and maybe even Cereal Killer himself are after this reward. We’d like to be there first! The issue is that the blockchain is protected with a proprietary algorithm. Reverse engineer the nft_extractor binary and discover how to unlock the rest of the blockchain.

Pick your poison (you only need one of these):

Download Linux nft_extractor.bin (3.26MB)
SHA1: ba074872afcad52e318caffab3be8363a20811f4

Download Windows nft_extractor.exe (3.40MB)
SHA1: 9d79a31a3802f6d4c23dd6cae671434f5967388e

You will need both of these.
