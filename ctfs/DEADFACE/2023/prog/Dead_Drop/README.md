The Incident Response Team at Aurora Pharmaceuticals recently recovered this file from a user’s computer. The artifacts indicate it was accessed by what they believe to be multiple DEADFACE members. The program appears to have set up the user’s workstation as a dead drop for DEADFACE members to convert a secret numerical code into a password string for further target access. Our decoding attempts have been unsuccessful, but the script appears to contain a recovery code that may be a good starting point.

Submit the flag as flag{the password} exactly how print_password() returns it.
