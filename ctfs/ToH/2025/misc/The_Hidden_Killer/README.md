The FBI just updated the serial killer database, but suddenly seems like the US are becoming too concerned about privacy... and now low-level policemen are allowed to make arrests but not to access the arrest data from other arrests. Normally, this wouldn't be a real problem, but these days it's spreading some rumors about the capture of the most infamous serial killer of all time: the Zodiac Killer. They even say she's a woman and she's called Zoe Diack! Bob the cop is a true-crime fan and wants to get some proof of it. Will he be able to satiate his curiosity and verify the rumors?
