It's summer. You're heading back home after an evening at the beach. Looking out of the car window, bored, you tune into the radio. It's been so long. Listening to this old recording, you can't even recall exactly when it was.

Submit the date and time of the recording in the format toh{DD-MM-YYYY-HH-MM}. The time should be provided in the local time zone where the audio was recorded.

Hint: The answer isn't in the file metadata.
