We've all been there. You just bought a new shiny gadget and the first thing that comes to mind is to dump its firmware and see if you can find something interesting. This time you'll have the chance to do it with a clear purpose: find the flag that's somewhere in there. What's more, you'll be able to pick the embedded system flavor you're more comfortable with: Linux, RTOS or bare metal. Choose more than one if you're a pro.

This is the Linux challenge.
