I saw a church in the distance while travelling. Can you tell me where it is?

The flag consists of latitude and longitude coordinates of the location where the photo was taken, rounded to three decimal places, and the name of the church in the distance in lowercase (according to google maps, omitting any potential spaces, punctuation and diacritics).

Regarding flag format, consider this example for Notre Dame de Paris: grey{N48-853_E2-349_notredamecathedralofparis}
