Little John, a true Gen Alpha, is making his first C program! Well, it’s just a "brainrot song library", though. Complete with nonsense words such as 'skibidi', 'rizz', and 'mewing'...

Anyways, Little John is using his dad’s computer, and we need you to exploit his program so that it can read a hidden file Little John’s dad hid, even if it’s not listed in the program. We don’t know the file name though, so good luck with that!
