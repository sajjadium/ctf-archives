My friend told me that they hiked on a trail that had 4 warning signs at the trailhead: Hazardous cliff, falling rocks, flash flood, AND strong currents! Could you tell me where they went? They did hint that these signs were posted on a public hawaiian hiking trail.

Note: the intended location has all 4 signs in the same spot. It is 4 permanent distinct signs - not 4 warnings on one sign or on a whiteboard.

Note: Feel free to try multiple plus codes. The answer skews roughly one "plus code tile" south/west of where many people think it is.

Flag is the full 10 digit plus code containing the signs they are mentioning, (e.g. lactf{85633HC3+9X} would be the flag for Bruin Bear Statue at UCLA). The plus code is in the URL when you select a location, or click the ^ at the bottom of the screen next to the short plus code to get the full length one. If your plus code contains 3 digits after the plus sign, zoom out and try selecting again.
