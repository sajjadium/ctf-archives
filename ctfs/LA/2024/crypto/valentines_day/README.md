Happy Valentine's Day! I'm unfortunately spending my Valentine's Day working on my CS131 homework. I'm getting bored so I wrote something for my professor. To keep it secret, I encrypted it with a Vigenere cipher with a really long key (161 characters long!)

As a hint, I gave you the first part of the message I encrypted. Surely, you still can't figure it out though?

Flag format is lactf{xxx} with only lower case letters, numbers, and underscores between the braces.
