Portal Tips Double Dashes ("--") Please do not use double dashes in any text boxes you complete or emails you send through the portal. The portal will generate an error when it encounters an attempt to insert double dashes into the database that stores information from the portal.

Also, apologies for the very basic styling. Our unpaid LA Housing(tm) RA who we voluntold to do the website that we gave FREE HOUSING for decided to quit - we've charged them a fee for leaving, but we are stuck with this website. Sorry about that.

Please note, we do not condone any actual attacking of websites without permission, even if they explicitly state on their website that their systems are vulnerable.
