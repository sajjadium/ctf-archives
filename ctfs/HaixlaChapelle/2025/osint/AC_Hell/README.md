I made this important recording near 50.780994, 6.050629 at some point during this year, but I forgot when exactly. Can you help me find out when I made it?

The flag is the seconds since epoch (UTC) when I started recording, in the format haix{<epoch_time>}. For example, if the time was 2025-11-29 10:00:00 (CET), the flag would be haix{1764406800}.
