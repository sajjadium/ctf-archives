We found Captain Ciphers spaceship the Crypto Voyager! It carries a very valuable cargo of intergalactic supplies. Sadly Captain Cipher quickly shut the hangar doors when we got too close and we didn't bring our drill. Luckily for us, we managed to tap into the exposed hangar maintenance interface and our inside man dumped the door logic for us. If you can open the hangar door, we will double you share!
