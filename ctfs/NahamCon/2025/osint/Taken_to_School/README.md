"I was reading the news this week, and I saw that a student tried to hack a school's computer system!" a worried professor remarked to an IT employee during lunch. "I'm glad we've got people like you keeping our network safe." While Bob the IT admin appreciated the warm comment, his stomach dropped. "Dang it.. I haven't checked that firewall since we set it up months ago!".

IT has pulled a log file of potentially anomalous events detected by the new (albeit poorly tuned) network security software for your school. Based on open-sourced intelligence (OSINT), identify the anomalous entry in the file.

Each log entry contains a single line, including an MD5 hash titled eventHash.

The challenge flag is flag{MD5HASH} containing the eventHash of the anomalous entry.
