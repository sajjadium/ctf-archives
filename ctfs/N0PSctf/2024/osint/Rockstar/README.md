I recently went to this place, and I really liked the design of their menu. Can you tell me which software they used to make it?

Note: The flag will be N0PS{Name of the software}. A strict copy-paste of the value you will find has to be submitted. For example, if the software is Acrobat PDFMaker 8.1 for Word (Macintosh), the flag will be N0PS{Acrobat PDFMaker 8.1 for Word (Macintosh)}.
