I saw my classmate doing homework in the stadium instead of watching the basketball game (what a nerd!). I texted him and asked if he could share his answers. Instead of texting them to me, he pulled a piece of paper, wrote answers on it, then crumpled and tried to tossed it to me across the court. It (obviously) was a bad idea; it almost hit our mascot Purdue Pete!
