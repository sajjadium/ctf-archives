Bilbin

I was on the bus the other day, and an old man had a heart attack, dropping to the ground. I rushed over to him, about to call 911. He said "It's over for me, son, but I do have one final request." He reached into his pocket and handed me a flash drive, and with his dying breath, said "Give my wife this message." I nodded my head and somberly walked away. To be honest, I had no intentions of actually doing this, but I guess you can. What did he want to tell her?
