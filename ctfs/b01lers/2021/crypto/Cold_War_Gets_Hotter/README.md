Our enemies at IU have become emboldened. Normally only words and rhetoric would be their weapons, but they are escalating. We have received a message from them that reads:

We are done with all of your "IU Sucks" all the time. This is going to end. We will destroy the heart of your campus, the Union, and there will be nothing you can do to stop this.

After receiving the message we received confirmation of a missle launch from their football field. We were then contacted from our mole on the inside from which we were told that IU allows altering of the missle's target coordinates. They targeted our union, now we must target theirs.....

Our mole was able to send us the encrypted message that had the original target coordinates and the script they use to validate new coordinates. Hurry and alter the coordinates, we must make sure our way of life can continue.
