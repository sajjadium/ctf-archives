We have intercepted two encrypted transmissions from the Automaton faction. These robotic adversaries have proven themselves persistent, calculating, and—most alarmingly—quite chatty. High Command has designated these messages as priority intelligence assets.

Intel has shown us that the Bots currently do not have enough processing power to apply robust encryption methods. As such, they have been known to reuse keys in order to allocate more computing resources to the frontline.

FYI: A related illegal broadcast from the Bot front was recorded last week, stating: "Heart. Steel. We. Kill. Iron. Will. Onto War!"

We trust you will use this information to your advantage.
