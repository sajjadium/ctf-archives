Our MAPNA flags repository was compromised, with attackers introducing one invalid flag. Can you identify the counterfeit flag?

Note: Forgot the flag format in the rules pages, just find the tampered one.

You are not allowed to brute-force the flag in scoreboard, this will result in your team being blocked.
