Last night when I was monitoring the network connections of my computer I found that it was communicating with a remote server and I think it is backdoored. The packets exchanged are also encrypted. An interesting thing I observed was that these connections only happen when I use sudo. Can you help me find out the backdoor and what data was compromised?
