My friend is really adventurous and a total sucker for a thrill and sci-fi movie-type action. He used to tell me how he would come to this spot in the image and just enjoy the unique view, and his mother would worry all evening. Now, he's gone MIA again. He loves to be alone and gatekeep these secret locations he has fun at.

Now I can't contact him at all and his mother is really worried. Find out for me where he has gone... I am sure he is posting about this trip on some secret social account."

Flag Format: The flag is composed of three parts joined by underscores:

Coordinates: The location coordinates of the first image up to 3 decimal places.(35.567, 108.321)

Username: The username of the secret account. (eg. fanboy_g4m1n6_30)

Place: The name of the location where he went aloof. (Mount Abu)
