We know the Dr. Tom is currently on the lookout for another cryptid. We think he might have made a mistake and is instead following someone in a costume. We got a tip that Dr. Tom was harassing a famous actor who happened to be in costume for their upcoming movie and was simply visiting a business because they had posted about him recently on their social media. We hacked into Dr. Tom's phone and got a picture from where he started and the path he took. It must've been pretty realistic - do you know what the character is called?
