NICC is hot on the trail of bigfoot! He has been following a path equivalent to the curve y^2 = x^3 + 73x + 42 mod 251. Each point along this curve represents one of Bigfoot's hideouts. NICC dicovered in his cave located at (26,38), many references to Green Lantern comics. A large depiction of Green Lantern with 13 rings on his fingers was drawn on the cave wall. I think this is the cover to an old issue of Green Lantern, could something about the issue point to how many more hideouts Bigfoot will travel through before stopping again?
