She's everywhere. I can't escape, she is omnipresent, overwhelming, persistent. I leave my dorm, I see a USC Tetris recruitment poster by the door. I wait for the bus, there's a poster on the stop. The bulletin board by the lecture hall advertises Trojan Tetris. I go to lunch, she is sitting by the line with a Mr. Cheese plushie. "Join the team!" she pipes, looking up from her sub 170 pace Jstris 100L cheese run. I try to escape, I sprint out the door. She sprints faster, she is 6pps. "Just downstack bro" with a flourish, she allspins around and sends a fullscreen spike. The recruitment energy is too strong, I've joined USC Tetris. And she will never let us leave.
