We've noticed the NSA is broadcasting a weird encrypted message repeatedly. So, we hired a shaman to help us extract the key of the encrypted message. The shaman did his work told us something like: "Using my black magic voodoo sh\*t I've managed to zeroed out a different byte every broadcast, the byte was zeroed out in the data before the last AES 128 ECB sub-bytes round... I've also summoned a file called FLAG.enc". We told him: "WTF?!? Where is our key? We paid you a lot of money!". Anyway, we've manged to intercept 16 weird different broadcasts. Please help us retrieve the key.
