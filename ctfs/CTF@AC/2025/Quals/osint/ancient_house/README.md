Having set out into the world, the elder brother stopped in a kingdom where he proclaimed himself king. When word spread through the land about the so-called new king, the whole people rose in revolt. A narcissistic herald, angered by the intruder’s deed, swore never, for as long as he lived, to set foot on the land touched by the so called king. And one day, as he pondered how to gain recognition from the heralds of the south, the north, and the east, he decided to name his fortress in his own honor. Said and done. He hung the coats of arms of all the houses in his fortress, but among all these houses, only one stood out: the house whose emblem bore three red beads.

What is the name of this house?
