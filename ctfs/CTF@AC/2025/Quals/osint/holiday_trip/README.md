My brother went to the beach last week. He knows I collect novelty mugs so he picked one up for me - but, as always, he couldn’t resist turning it into a challenge.

So he sent me a photo saying, “Picked one up for you and left it at the our parents house. Father will keep it hidden until you can tell him where I bought it.”

Your mission: help me find the beach where my brother bought the mug in order to get it from my father.
