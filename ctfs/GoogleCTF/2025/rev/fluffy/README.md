I don’t trust anyone anymore... I have written my own App to protect my secrets. I also used my own encryption algorithm, because I believe security by obscurity is the best. But, I didn’t have time to implement the decryption functionality yet. My friend from Switzerland told me to not bother myself with it as he was able to recover my secrets in 5 minutes... How is this even possible?
