This challenge takes you back to the (good) old days of crackmes.de.
Your goal for this challenge is to write a "keygen", a program that
generates valid passwords for arbitrary given usernames.
You are also given `flag_maker.py` that contains a list of usernames
that you have to find their corresponding passwords.
Once you find all passwords, run the script and you will get the flag.
