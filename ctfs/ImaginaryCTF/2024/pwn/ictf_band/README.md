Did you know that our team at ImaginaryCTF has a band called ictf-band? Formed in 2024, our band consists of four talented musicians and one incredible vocalist, each highly skilled in their respective roles.

Recently, we've encountered challenges in coming up with new song titles and writing lyrics. To address this, we've developed an innovative application called ictf-band, accessible to the public via Command Line Interface (CLI). This application allows users to contribute song titles and lyrics, with all responses and data being saved for our creative process.

As we continue to enhance our application, we're seeking insights from cybersecurity experts to identify potential vulnerabilities. As a vulnerability researcher, your expertise in uncovering and addressing these vulnerabilities is invaluable. We're particularly interested in understanding the worst possible outcomes to ensure our application remains secure and robust.
