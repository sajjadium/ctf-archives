Never have I seen a pickle, worming its way out of a jail, whose exploitation did not rely upon the calling of some nefarious function. Thus, I hereby declare: there shall be no call heeded within this domain anymore. It is for I yearn the secure confinement of pickles; and shall not stand their escape.
