We all have that one teammate who promises to deliver challenges for the CTF, but always just barely makes it in time, leaving no room for testing. Usually, it works out in the end...

But not this time. They’re so late that the CTF is already live, and all we have is a half-finished challenge and a lot of frustration!

The last message we got from the author said: "Sry for being late this year. Next year for sure. I’ll hide in my favourite food place until this blows over. uwu"

We remember the original goal of the challenge was to find their favorite restaurant, so maybe we can still salvage something from the existing code.

Can you uncover where the culprit is hiding and bring them to justice? There might even be a little reward waiting for you in the restaurant’s review section...
