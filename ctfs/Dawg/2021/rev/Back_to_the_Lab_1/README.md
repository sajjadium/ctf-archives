We've gotten hold of the plant control program, but the MELTDOWN button is locked. Figure out the flag and press the button!

Note: To run the program, you'll have to press the Run button in the upper left of the window. Press the Abort button to stop it.

Note: To run the program, you'll need some rather expensive software; look for the "community edition", it's free. It's bulky, so maybe consider installing on a VM.
