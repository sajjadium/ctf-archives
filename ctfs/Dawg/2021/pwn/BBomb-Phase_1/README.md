Welcome to the CyberDawgs Binary Bomb challenge series! The "bbomb" binary contains a series of mini reversing challenges broken into 9 phases. Each phase becomes incresingly more difficult, but it is not required to solve a phase to move onto the next. Simply press enter for a phase's input to skip it. Additionally, known phase solutions can be stored in a file named "flags.txt". See the binary's welcome message for the format and requirements. When submitting to this scoreboard, wrap the phase's solution in DawgCTF{}. Happy reversing!
