I'm trying to find a flight I took back in 2012. I forgot the airport and the plane, but I know it is the one with an orange/red logo on the right side of this photo I took. Can you help me identify it?

The flag format is UofTCTF{AIRPORT_AIRLINE_AIRCRAFT}. AIRPORT is the 3 letter IATA code, AIRLINE is the name of the airline (dash-separated if required), and AIRCRAFT is the aircraft model and variant (omit manufacturer name). For example, UofTCTF{YYZ_Air-Canada_A320-200} or UofTCTF{YYZ_Delta_767-300}.

Note: The aircraft variant should be of X00 format; ie. there may be models with XYZ-432, but the accepted variant will be XYZ-400.
