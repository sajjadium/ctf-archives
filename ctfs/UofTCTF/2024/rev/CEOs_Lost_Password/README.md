Hello there brave programmer!

I am the CEO of TotallySecureBank™, I have a lot of money in my bank account but I forgot my password! My username is admin and I have $100000 in my account.

If you could recover my account you can use my password as a flag (flag would be uoftctf{MyPasswordHere})

You can try the bank software by running java -jar BankChallenge.jar and use the admin user user with the password
