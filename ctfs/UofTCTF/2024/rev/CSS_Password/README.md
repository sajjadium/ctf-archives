My web developer friend said JavaScript is insecure so he made a password vault with CSS. Can you find the password to open the vault?

Wrap the flag in uoftctf{}

Make sure to use a browser that supports the CSS :has selector, such as Firefox 121+ or Chrome 105+. The challenge is verified to work for Firefox 121.0.
