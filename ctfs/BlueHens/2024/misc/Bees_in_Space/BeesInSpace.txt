According to all known	laws of	aviation, there	is no	way
a	bee
should be able to fly. Its	wings are too small	to get its
fat	little
body off the ground. The bee,	of course, flies anyway because	bees	don't
care	what
humans think is impossible. Yellow, black.	Yellow, black.	Yellow, black.	Yellow, black. Ooh,
black	and
yellow! Let's shake it up a	little. Barry! Breakfast is	ready!	Coming! Hang
on	a
second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you	believe	this	is	happening? I	can't.	I'll
pick	you
up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs,	Your	father	paid good	money	for	those.
Sorry.	I'm
excited. Here's the graduate. We're very	proud	of you,	son. A perfect report
card,	all
B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a	thing	going here. You got	lint
on	your
fuzz. Ow! That's me! Wave to	us!	We'll	be in	row 118,000. Bye!
Barry,	I
told you, stop flying in the house!	Hey,	Adam. Hey, Barry.	Is	that
fuzz	gel?
A little. Special day, graduation. Never	thought	I'd	make it. Three	days	grade
school,	three
days high school. Those were awkward.	Three	days	college. I'm glad I took
a	day
and hitchhiked around The Hive. You did	come	back different.	Hi, Barry. Artie,
growing	a
mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie?	Yeah.	You going to the	funeral?	No,
I'm	not
going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.	Don't	waste it on	a	squirrel.
Such	a
hothead. I guess he could have	just gotten	out	of	the	way.	I
love	this
incorporating an amusement park into our day.	That's	why we don't need	vacations.
Boy,	quite
a bit of pomp under the circumstances.	Well,	Adam, today	we are	men.
We	are!
Bee-men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished	bees, please	welcome	Dean	Buzzwell.	Welcome,	New

Will we pick our job today? I	heard	it's just orientation. Heads up!
Here	we
