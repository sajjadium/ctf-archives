bkfish在自己的虚拟机里运行了某些命令之后用"sudo reboot"重启了主机，接着他按照网上清除入侵记录的方法先"rm -rf .bash_history"然后"history -c"删除了所有的命令记录。

在现实世界中，消失的东西就找不回来了，但在网络世界里可未必如此，你能找到bkfish消失的秘密吗?

After running some commands in his virtual machine, bkfish restarted the host with “sudo reboot”. Then he followed the method of clearing intrusion records on the Internet, first “rm -rf .bash_history” and then “history -c” to delete all command records.

In the real world, things that disappear can never be found again, but this may not be the case in the online world. Can you find bkfish’s lost secret?
