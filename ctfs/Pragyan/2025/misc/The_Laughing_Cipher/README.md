Batman intercepts an encrypted message from Joker on a compromised GCPD server:

"Oh, Bats! A little surprise is wired to Gotham’s power grid. Tick tock!"

Batman discovers that there is a deactivation code, and hopes to find it in the Joker's network traffic.

Batman plants this in the bashrc file :

    export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/home/gotham/logs/keys.log

Batman sneaks back inside the Joker's lair to retrive the logs but it seems corrupted. With the Joker's henchmen around the corner, he checks for running scripts and copies this file along the log. Help Batman save the city.

Return the flag as p_ctf{FLAG}
