Into a galaxy of bits and bytes

Among the stars you will encounter death

Will you keep moving even without breath?

Ribbit ribbit go the frogs of the night

To you, the stars and hoppers are a blight

They will consume you if you search first breadth

And will still win if you try search first depth

In the zeros and ones, will you find light?

Feed the universe with characters freely

Your generosity will move you around

Can you walk through dangers without any lag?

Dangers have been sprung around meerily

There are leaks in the buffers to be found
