I think it's time to mix things up a little bit. This time, I'm going to give you an application that will reveal the flag. All you have to do is guess the right key. Shouldn't be too hard - 22 characters, A-Z, a-z, 0-9, !-*

I know what you're thinking. "This isn't a crack challenge." I know, but I'm out of ideas for challenges and I'm phoning this one in. Just crack the stupid key. Your only other choice is to either decompile and reverse engineer the key (boring), or grab it from the running process when it validates (impossible.) Cracking passwords is way more fun (sigma gigachad move.)
