I got into CTFs a long time ago. Despite that, I remember how tough it was. It seemed impossible to solve all of the challenge. Heck, it seemed impossible to solve one. I remember how intimidating it was, but I also remember how amazing it felt to solve my first challenge and submit my first flag.

Looking back, it wasn't a tough challenge, but it was a start. Well, here's your chance. This is a recreation of the very first CTF challenge I solved. If you manage to solve this one, just remember that this is where I started, too.
