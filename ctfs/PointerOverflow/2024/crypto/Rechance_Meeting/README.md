Full disclosure... I can't even remember what this challenge was supposed to be about. See, I do development of the contest over the summer, and I also have a lot of other things going on. Mostly birthdays. It seems like almost everyone in my life has a summer birthday. You'd think that there would be an equal chance of any given day being someones birthday, but I'm afraid it just doesn't work that way.

I'm just going to give you the files and hopefully you can figure it out. Looks like I wrote a hash function. And this other thing looks like a word list. I definitely remember putting the flag in the archive. I also definitely remember that the password for the archive was two words from the list mashed together. As in, if the two words on this were "like" and "this" then the password for the archive is the two of them together "likethis"

So... uh, good luck! I guess!
