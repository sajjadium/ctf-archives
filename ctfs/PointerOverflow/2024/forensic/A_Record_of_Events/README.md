Here's a simple forensics challenge for you. An old flash drive that was lost on the streets near campus one day. I intended to find the owner and return it, but unfortunately I couldn't work out exactly who it belonged to. It hadn't been connected to any campus computers, so that was a dead end. Seems like it might have belonged to one of the missionaries we get on campus sometimes but that doesn't narrow it down much. So I set it in my safe with the intention of taking it to the lost and found, but I forgot about it for about twenty years instead. I only found it again when I was cleaning out my safe. I suppose it's time to dispose of it, but let's throw a challenge on here before we send it to the great by-and-by.
