I was inspired to create this challenge after a real case I worked. In my experience, actual steganography is pretty rare and typically signifies a subject with advanced domain competency in counter-forensics. Most subjects will use encryption or basic obfuscation because you get similar results with less hassle. Only the most sensitive of evidence and most paranoid of subjects encrypt and hide their data.

I was contacted to reexamine evidence in a criminal case. It was an alleged criminal conspiracy with multiple subjects. Five, to be exact, and it was suspected that there was a sixth. The only problem was that there was no solid evidence directly linking this sixth member to the conspiracy. I took a look and discovered a situation that is crudely reproduced in this challenge.

NOTE: The flag for this challenge uses a '1' in place of both the 'i' and 'l' characters. You can submit the flag as found, or using the character set in the rules. Either will be accepted.
