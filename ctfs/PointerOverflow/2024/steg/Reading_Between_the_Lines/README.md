Good news, everyone! I've decided it's time to write my memoirs. After a lifetime of interesting experiences, I think it's time the astounding story of my life be recorded for the benefit and advancement of humanity. I can tell everyone about the time that I... Hmm... Ok, maybe my life isn't so interesting after all...

...But it can be! I'm going to throw in a couple interesting details! Give it a little something extra! No one will notice if I embellish a little as long as I don't change it too much. I can always just put a disclaimer on it that its only based on true events - a little transparency is a good thing.
