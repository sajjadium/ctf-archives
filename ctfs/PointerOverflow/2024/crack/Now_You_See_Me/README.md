Another Crack challenge, and I'm going to make this tricky by giving you a series of cryptic clues, then it'll be up to you to work your magick and find the flag. Here are two images. One is a key. The other you can't see because it's encrypted, but it's the flag.

MD5 checksum 0AA46A2867C4339EBDBC4955B3BD237D

MD5 checksum B9DFD8F6D8101A2C32B5C28277B43CB5

Ok. Here are your clues:
1) [A-Z0-9]{10}
2) The password is somewhere in this text.
