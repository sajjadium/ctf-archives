2. 48 = ___

3. 80, 85, 96, 101, 112, ___

4. Let f(x) = 2*x^2 + 3*x - 5 and g(x) = (x + 4) / (x + 5) and solve for: f(g(20)) + 10 * ((e^3 - 20) / 3) + 95 = ___ Where: e is 2.718.

5. 0x64 + 15 = ___

6. 41, 0x38, 69, 0x50, 89, 0x60, 101, ___

7. f(x)=(x*2)+10 x=___ where f=114

8. 1, 17, 33, ___

9. Asset Value = $50,000, Exposure Factor = 60%, ARO = 0.0036667, ALE = ___

10. 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ___

11. min(max(0.3*100+0.3*50+10,0.1*150+1.0*50+47))

12. MTTC = {40, 28, 35, 42, 30}

NOTE: The solution will produce the flag in the form of an English quote or phrase using the alphabet in the rules for flags. If your solution produces a choice of characters, the correct answer is the one that is part of the character set, or completes the proper phrase.
