It might be the company I keep, but I rarely see good old bin patch challenges in CTFs these days. It might be because they tend to be a bit on the simple side, but in my day they were essential skills. It's not much, but is honest work. I'd wake up every morning after the preamble and JMP to wherever the work was that day. I'd PUSH and POP until the cows come home then I'd MOV on to the end of the day until work JLE 0 then NOP out of there and RET home to finally HALT.

Here's a chance for you to give it a try for yourselves. There are other ways to solve this one, sure, but I reckon the easiest way is to just bypass the password request. You'll need the key file to decrypt, and this time you'll be working with a PE instead of an ELF to give the challenge just a little more of that down-home country flavor.
