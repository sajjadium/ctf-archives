What are these SMS I received as soon as I connected to the gNB? Hint: To confiure NAS5GS, please follow this guide https://github.com/SysSec-KAIST/LTESniffer/blob/main/pcap_file_example/README.md for the first part and enable the NR/5GS equivalent protocols of the LTEs one presented in 2nd part (i.e. MAC-NR,PDCP-NR,RLC-NR,NAS-5GS) PS:These packets are valid transmissions with an actual phone
