With the failure of his composite modulus scheme and the Leaking Oracle, Decimus Cryptonicus grew desperate.

"They mock my work," he muttered in his study, staring at the burning city of Carthage. "They say my encryptions are flawed. Fine. I shall create something so cursed, so incomprehensible, that even the gods will weep!"

Thus, he devised his final creation:

"I shall take the Emperor’s message… and shift each letter by 8000 places in the grand library of Unicode!"

His assistants recoiled in horror.

"But, Master… that will transform the message into pure gibberish! No one will be able to read it!"

"Exactly," Decimus cackled. "The best encryption is the one even I cannot decrypt!"

And so, the Curse of Rot8000 was unleashed. The flag was shattered into unreadable abominations, encoded with UTF-16 sorcery so vile that even the gods of Olympus refused to interpret it.

But among the Numerii, whispers spread.

"This is madness," one muttered. "But madness… can be reversed."

With knowledge of character distributions, they began the ritual of reversing Rot8000, peeling away its cursed transformation, letter by letter.

Decimus had tried to outsmart the world, but in his arrogance, he had created something that could still be undone.

His final mistake had yet to be exploited…
