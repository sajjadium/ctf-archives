Modern day script kiddies like to encrypt their conversations using this weird "zlib" thing. I had literally never heard of it.

Doesn't look safe, you say? Well, no one expects it so it works!

I created this majestic tool to look for zlib-encrypted messages in Word documents, because I'm fascinated by this zlib-encryption everyone uses.
