In the hills of what is now called Italy, near a village long vanished from maps, there was a whisper — a prophecy — that ten days would one day disappear.

The prophecy spoke not of war, nor plague, but of a child born beneath a sky with no shadow.

The village was called Bellombra, and the people there had learned to fear silence.

One autumn evening, the bells rang thirteen times at dusk. A woman in black gave birth beneath the old chapel tree. The child had no cry — only a pulse like thunder.

The next morning, men in Rome sent letters in haste. Monks tore pages from their ledgers. Timekeepers smashed their own sundials.

Ten days never arrived. They were not forgotten — they were stolen.

The elders of Bellombra swore they saw them drifting like smoke into the child’s breath.

No one could say what happened in the days that should have followed. Only that they should have been there.

It was then that a man arrived, cloaked in violet, riding a horse that cast no shadow. He bore no name, only a number sewn in silver across his sleeve: XIII.

Some called him a sorcerer. Others, a scholar. The villagers only called him the Thirteenth.

He spoke not to the people, but to the hour itself. With ink and flame, he sealed something shut — not to fix what had happened, but to keep it from spreading.

"It is done," he said. "The wound cannot be undone. But it can be explained — and remembered."

Before he vanished, he left a single line etched into the chapel stone:

"Mark the last day the world stood whole — for the child took the rest."

Tell me, traveler,

What was the date of birth of the child ?
