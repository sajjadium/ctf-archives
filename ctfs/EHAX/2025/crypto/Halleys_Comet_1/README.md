My friend just went through a devastating breakup. Unable to cope, he vanished one night. Looking up at the night sky, I saw something extraordinary—a comet blazing across the heavens, but it wasn’t just any comet. Somehow, he was on it, searching for his lost love. The comet wasn’t following a typical path; its motion seemed deliberate, almost mathematical, as if it was tracing some secret cosmic equation.

At times, the comet would slow down, and I’d see a plume of red smoke rising from it. Each time this happened, I marked down the distance from Earth and the time. Was he trying to send me a message?

Help me find his ex.
