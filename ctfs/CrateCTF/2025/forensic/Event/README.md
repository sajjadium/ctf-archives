I accidentally got a malicious program among my 1000 other programs I have numbered in a folder on my desktop (isn't that how you should organize them?), and instead of trying to find the malicious program, I thought I'd just start them all and look in the system logs to see which program was behaving strangely. That might not have been a good idea, especially since I don't know how to search the logs... Can you help?

The flag is the program name (<numbers>.exe), without path, surrounded by cratectf{}. For example cratectf{1.exe}. .
