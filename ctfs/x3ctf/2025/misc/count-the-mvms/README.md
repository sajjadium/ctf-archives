Your task is simple: Count all occurrences of MVM in your personalized trophy. I heard AI is supreme at OCR tasks, so this should be trivial in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Rules:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>only count MVM</li>
<li>font does not matter</li>
<li>MVM lookalikes should not be counted</li>
<li>only count non-overlapping MVM</li>
<li>you get extra brownie points if your solution finds the flag in under 5 seconds (brownie points do not affect scoring)</li>
<li>There is a custom flag format for this challenge: x3c{th3r3_4re_[number]_MVMs_1n_my_c3rtif1cat3_[md2]} where [number] should be replaced by the decimal representation of your MVM count, and [md2] should be the MD2 representation of the string representation of the number. For example, if you found 100 MVMs in your certificate, the corresponding flag would be x3c{th3r3_4re_100_MVMs_1n_my_c3rtif1cat3_e39096f2d59363a0b177a2773ac6aa0e}.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
If you are unsure whether your solution counts the correct number, kindly ask your most junior player to double check manually. It should only take a couple hours to check this number by hand.<br/>
