HTTP/3 is just the best version of HTTP, wait a few years ~~, until setting up an HTTP/3 server will not be a pain,~~ and you’ll see. I hid a secret on /flag, you can only get it if you become a real HTTP/3 enjoyer.

NOTE: This challenge uses only HTTP/3, browsers are a bit hesitant in using it by default, so you’ll have to use explicit arguments to do so.

In chrome you can do the following:

chrome --enable-quic --origin-to-force-quic-on=enjoyer.challs.ctf.srdnlen.it
