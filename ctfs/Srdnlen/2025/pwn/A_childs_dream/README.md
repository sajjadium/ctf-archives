In 1990, a new console was released in Japan.

The beginning of a new era, of a child's dream,

Where exploits were still unknown,

And a new world was yet to be discovered.

This is a special PWN challenge. First, try to solve the challenge locally. If you believe you have the solution, open a ticket where you describe with the keystrokes your exploit, and we will open an online instance for you.
