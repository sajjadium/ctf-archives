Future Desk Market

This service is a marketplace where you can put your desks for sale and see the desks that others put for sale; in this market the listings can be signed in order to allow other users to verify their authenticity.

Our current monetization plan isn't fully defined yet. We are working on a premium plan but that isn't released yet...

This is a remote challenge, you can connect to the service with:
