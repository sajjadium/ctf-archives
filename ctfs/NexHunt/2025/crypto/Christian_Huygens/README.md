The following description is based on the current agenda of the Nuxhunt. This agenda reflects the planned structure for now, but it may be updated or adjusted as the event approaches. The Nuxhunt competition is structured as a full 24-hour cybersecurity challenge designed to immerse participants in a continuous, progressive hacking experience supported by scheduled activities, meals, and organized sessions. The event begins on Friday, when participants arrive for check-in at 14:00. During this period, teams complete their registration, receive their badges or necessary materials, and settle into the event environment. At 15:30, teams proceed to their assigned seating areas and perform their initial network setup. This allows each team to establish their working environment, verify access to competition systems, and ensure that their equipment is properly configured for the start of the CTF. The Opening Ceremony begins at 16:00, where organizers formally welcome participants, outline the rules and expectations, and provide an overview of the competition structure. Immediately after, at 17:00, the first wave of CTF challenges officially launches. Teams begin working on the available tasks, exploring the categories, and building early momentum as they navigate the initial problems. At 21:30, participants are given a scheduled Dinner Break, offering time to rest, refresh, and regroup. Following dinner, the competition continues into the night. To support participants during the long overnight portion, a Midnight Snack / Late Night Bites service is offered at 02:00, ensuring that teams can maintain energy and focus throughout extended hours of problem-solving. The hacking session continues uninterrupted overnight, allowing teams to manage their time and strategy as they see fit. On Saturday, the day begins with Breakfast Service at 08:00, providing teams with an opportunity to recharge before the second half of the event. At 09:00, the Second Wave of challenges unlocks, introducing new problems and raising the competitive intensity. The schedule then integrates two conference sessions to enrich the educational aspect of the event. At 10:30, the first conference session takes place, covering the designated morning topic. This provides participants a chance to learn from experts and momentarily shift into a more observant, knowledge-building mode. Afterward, teams return to hacking until 13:00, when lunch is served. At 15:00, the second conference session begins, offering another opportunity for participants to gain insight into the afternoon’s chosen topic. This session further complements the hands-on experience of the CTF with structured learning. As the competition enters its final phase, a One-Hour Warning is issued at 16:00, accompanied by the scoreboard freeze, signaling that the last moments of progress will be hidden from public view to maintain suspense. This creates a dramatic final stretch leading up to the event’s conclusion. The CTF officially ends at 17:00, at which point challenge submissions are closed. Shortly after, at 17:15, the event concludes with the Closing Ceremony & Awards, where the top-performing teams are recognized, highlights are shared, and the competition is formally brought to an end. This comprehensive agenda ensures that participants experience a fully structured, high-engagement cybersecurity competition supported by clear timing, adequate breaks, and supplemental conference content.
