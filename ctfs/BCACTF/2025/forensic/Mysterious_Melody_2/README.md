CORRECTION: For those who have solved part one of the challenge, the "short symphonic excerpt" is not at the beginning of the audio file; it starts later on in the file.

Attend, brave soul, to this melodic quest,
Where riddles lie in symphony's soft crest.
The audio's dawn, not music but a code,
Doth whisper secrets in a hex-lit mode.

Yet once that cryptic veil is swept away,
A master's hand begins a bold ballet—
Rachmaninoff, in fervent, grand display,
His Third Concerto's first proud arc doth play.

So listen well, where numbers speak in tone,
Then let the maestro's tempest guide you home.

The flag should be enclosed in bcactf{}.
