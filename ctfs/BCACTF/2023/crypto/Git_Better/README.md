We at BCACTF aspire to be unique.

That's why we decided to use our own ✨proprietary✨ VCS for this year's challenges. It's a new and more efficient1 way to manage challenge versions, using The Blockchain™.
If you're a cryptocurrency person though, this chain of blocks may disappoint you. But we here at BCACTF aspire to be unique, (see above,) and so we will do what we want and NOT what the users want.
Either way, we have a bit of an embarrassing situation on our hands. We just built our new flag validator, and in the process of copying the repository to the production server, we ran into a little issue... and lost one of our blocks.
So would you uh... be willing to copy that over? I'm on vacation, and you seem to be a part of the new workplace family, so I'm sure you'd be happy to help us out, right?
So would you be willing to copy over this block archive to the server? If you do that, I'd even give you ✨exclusive✨ access to the proprietary repository protocols.
Just please don't tamper with it, okay? Actually, I don't trust you. Blockchains are immutable for security purposes.
Now go get that second block in, okay?
