Anddddddddd I've realized I can't trust you. So I made that repo verification stronger.
Yeah yeah yeah, I heard that you thought:
"It's not secure enough!!11!1!!!!!!11!!!!" Yes it is. You're just using it wrong.
"I actually got your flag so maybe you have major security
vulnerabilities." I just don't listen to the haters.
"Ur r3po 5ys7em 5ux" What's that? You don't know how to spell? Poor you.
"This is an anonymous message from your team and I really need you to know
that if you don't make major changes you're going to end up with massive
security holes that are going to have major implications on the company's
reputation." You're fired.
128 bits of raw hashing power, baby. This one should be bulletproof. (Or computer proof.)
Oh and we had another transfer issue with the PERFECTLY DESIGNED SUPER ROBUST new system.
So can you copy it over again? Kthxbye.
