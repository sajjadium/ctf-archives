Here are some pictures.

The flag format will be bcactf{ANS1_ANS2_ANS3}, where:

    ANS1 is the first word of the what3words code of the main Google Maps pin on the circled building in geolocation-1.jpg. For example, if it was the Empire State Building (heave.wipes.clay), ANS1 would be "heave".
    ANS2 is the second word of the what3words code of the exact coordinates from the photosphere URL of geolocation-2.jpg.
    ANS3 is the third word of the what3words code of the exact coordinates from the Street View URL of geolocation-3.png.
