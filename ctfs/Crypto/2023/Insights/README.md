Boundary attacks on RSA involve manipulating the input values at specific boundaries to exploit vulnerabilities in the encryption system's implementation. As one of the most widely used encryption systems, RSA provides insights into secure communications through its reliance on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. However, it is crucial to implement RSA correctly with robust key management and secure implementations to ensure its effectiveness in protecting sensitive information.
