 Hi! This is Bob from incident response.

 Reaching to you regarding that ransomware attack we've had on

 our side-hosted server running "Windows Server 2019 Standard

 (17763.3650)". I was really surprised to find out MS Teams on

 the application list. Like, this a server, why would you need a

 corporate chat there?

 That looks kinda SUS, aren't you thinking so? That being said,

 attaching some related artifacts. Check asap.

 Best regards,

 Bob Guzini,

 Neck of IR Department.
