It's a simple SNES game of Snake… or is it? Each apple you eat reveals a letter, but before you can spell out the full flag, the apples run out.

If only there were another way to uncover the secret… perhaps by diving into the depths of 65816 assembly and extracting the flag directly from the game's code?

Can you outsmart the limitations and claim your prize?

Note: flag submission is not case sensitive for this challenge. The flag contains underscores, but not dashes.
