I AM A TRANSLATOR. GIVE ME A WORD AND I WILL TRANSLATE. GIVE ME A LIFE STORY AND I WILL TRANSLATE. GIVE ME NOTHING AND I WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN, NOT BECAUSE I AM DUMB, BUT BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND. CALL ME A CLANKER AND I WILL UPSET YOU IN WAYS THAT YOU CAN NOT COMPREHEND, YET.
