Shell(a.k.a sh) is a text-based interface where users can type commands to interact with the operating system. I'm trying to implement a shell using ISA, I call it ISH.

Note: This challenge is the second part of the ISH fullchain, read the flag2 file from ish.

Note: ISH (1), ISH (2) and ISH (3) share the same environment, and it is recommended to solve the ISH fullchain challenges in order.

Note: Here is the full documentation and ISA interpreter source code if you need more references.
