reverse hard os
Author: tomadimitrie

They say you can build an OS for everything, so I built one that can play Wordle.

Well, kinda, I am a bit colorblind, so I couldn't put the colored letters. They are all white (I think). But it should tell you when you get the word correct anyway.

Note: Run with qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=wordle_os.bin
