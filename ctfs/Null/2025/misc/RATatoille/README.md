forensics threat hunting malware analysis
Author: mrbgd

"In the dark corners of the internet, a new "Chef" is brewing a malicious recipe. This isn't your grandmothers soup; it is a sophisticated RAT hidden beneath layers of obfuscation and encryption. Just as Remy hides under Linguini's hat to control him, this malware hides its true intent behind a "chef's hat" of PowerShell scripts and batch files.

Your task is to play the role of Anton Ego. You must peel back the layers of this digital onion, taste the code, and identify the secret ingredients before the kitchen burns down. Can you find the recipe before the RAT takes control? Bon appétit!"
