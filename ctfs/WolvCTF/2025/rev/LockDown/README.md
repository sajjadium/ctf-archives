I'm trying to use this adder, but I can't figure out what password gets it to work. Can you figure it out?

NOTE: to get the flag, convert the password bit-string into an ASCII string, with _l47_ as the MSB and _l0_ as the LSB. For example, the password 01110111011000110111010001100110011110110110010101111000011000010110110101110000011011000110010101111101 would be converted to wctf{example}.
