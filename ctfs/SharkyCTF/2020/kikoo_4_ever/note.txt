I have a theory that anyone who spends most of their time on the internet, and has virtual friends, or not, knows at least one kikoo in their entourage. "Kikoo: A young teenager or child who uses text messaging, making numerous spelling mistakes, sometimes behaving immaturely, aggressively, vulgarly, rude, even violent, especially on the internet." - wiktionary.org That's the definition I found on wiktionary.org, but I think being a kikoo is not that pejorative, I also think you can be a kikoo no matter how old you are. Being a kikoo is having a different mentality, it's having a different humor, it's having different hobbies, being a kikoo is mostly an internet lover.

After reading these few lines, and that no one has come to mind, it's that there must be a problem, if there is, we'll fix it immediately. Don't worry, I'm going to teach you how to identify a kikoo, they have very characteristic behaviours, and that's what we're going to see in a moment. Start by running the program, then listen to my instructions...
