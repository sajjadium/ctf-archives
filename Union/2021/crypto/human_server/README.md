Ever since everyone left WhatsApp, we've been overwhelmed by new users. We've teamed up with UnionCTF to get some humans working while our servers take a break.

You'll be helping our users send flags to each other, but as we've ensured messages are E2E encrypted with state-of-the-art military-grade encryption, their messages will be private. Our customers have nothing to worry about.
