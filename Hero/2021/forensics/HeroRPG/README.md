This RPG game wasn't well designed, and I am pretty sure there is no way to win... Or is it ?

To run the game, go to the Hero/www folder and run sudo python3 -m http.server 80. The game is available through your browser : http://localhost:80

You can move around with the arrow keys, interact with enter, and open your inventory with X.
