I’ve been waiting anxiously for a package… Do you know what I bought?

Note: If the binary segfaults, try using a newer kernel (we verified that it works on Linux 5.0 and later). Sorry about that!

Note 2: Please download the challenge again (or change the byte at file offset 0x9058 from 0x07 to 0x0f), we fixed an alignment issue on some versions of Ubuntu (thank you to Redford for reporting that one)!
