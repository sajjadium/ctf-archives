You are about to begin working on a new pwnable challenge at 0ctf 2019, If on a winter's night a traveler. It is extremely easy and you soon finish your exploit, but cannot connect to the server. "Ah, yes", the organizer replies, "We have noticed this issue. Unfortunately, the vulnerability for this binary is too obvious that all our servers refuse to run it. As an alternative, we have deployed a new service receiving your exploit directly and judging it with our super fancy AI. You can find it on 111.186.63.13:10001. Good luck."
