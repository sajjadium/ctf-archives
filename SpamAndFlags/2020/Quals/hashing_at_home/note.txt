So we have come up with a distributed hashing solution , like other popular @home projects, but it's for profit and is used to enhance our clients security. Please donate your CPU time for this noble goal.
The client is distributed in source form, so you can compile it for your favorite UNIX clone. We also share the server source so you can audit it yourself.
Oh yeah, BTW, jemalloc is faster than "classic" malloc, so that's what we use on the server.
If you're a client of ours, and worried that your hashes will be sent to normal people, don't worry. We use a very secure salting method with a secure secret key, so noone will ever know what you need hashed.
