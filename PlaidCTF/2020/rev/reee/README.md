Tired from all of the craziness in the Inner Sanctum, you decide to venture out to the beach to relax. You doze off in the sand only to be awoken by the loud “reee” of an osprey. A shell falls out of its talons and lands right where your head was a moment ago. No rest for the weary, huh? It looks a little funny, so you pick it up and realize that it’s backwards. I guess you’ll have to reverse it.
