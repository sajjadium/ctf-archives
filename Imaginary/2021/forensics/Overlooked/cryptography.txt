Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós "hidden​​‌‌‭, secret"; and γράφειν​​‌​‪ graphein, "to write", or ​​‌​‬-λογία -logia, "study", respectively[1])​​‌‌‬, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication​​‌​‬ in the presence of third parties called adversaries.[2] More generally, cryptography is about constructing and ​​‌‌‬analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages;[3] various​​‌‌‭ aspects ​​‌​‪in information security such as data confidentiality​​‌​‌, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation[4] are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the ​​‌‌‍intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, ​​​﻿⁢computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based ​​‌‌‬payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.

Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting information from a ​​‌‌‬readable state to unintelligible nonsense. The sender of an encrypted message shares the​​‌‌﻿ decoding technique only with intended ​​‌‌‌recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often​​‌‌‪ uses the names Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve ("eavesdropper") for the adversary.[5] Since​​‌​​ the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and ​​‌​‍the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and​​‌‌‌ its applications more varied​​‌‌‪.

Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and ​​‌‌‭computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making​​‌​‪ such algorithms hard to break​​‌​‌ in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is ​​‌​‍infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed "computationally secure"; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in​​‌​‬ integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated, and if necessary, adapted.​​‌​⁣ There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such ​​‌​‌as the one-time pad, but these schemes are much more difficult to​​​﻿⁣ use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.

The growth​​‌‌⁢ of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal​​‌‌‭ issues in the information age. Cryptography's potential for ​​‌​‬use as a tool for​​‌‌​ espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a​​‌‍‍ weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export.[6] In some jurisdictions​​‌‌﻿ where the use of cryptography is legal, ​​‌‌‬laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents​​‌‌‍ relevant to an investigation.[7][8] Cryptography ​​‌​‎also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes in​​‌​⁣ regard to digital media.[9]​​‌​‪​​‌​‍
