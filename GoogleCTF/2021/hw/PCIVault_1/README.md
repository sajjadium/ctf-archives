We plan to extend our cloud offering with a secure key-value store. Right now
it is already a groundbreaking dedicated device that can store your data, but
in the future we will provide military-grade encryption capability.
You are one of the selected few that may test this offering in its alpha stage
so that we can send you a quick, three hour survey afterwards.
The login for your dedicated VM is `root:password`.

The flag-vm uses the same kernel + driver as the challenge-vm.
