My friend just got a PhD in geography and now makes cool challenges. 

If you can solve this one,  I can get you his autograph. 

The only thing he told me is to “read between the flags”, no idea what that means.

Place the answer in the flag format, like so: DO{...}

Please convert all characters to uppercase.
