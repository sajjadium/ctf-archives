RSA is the hardest and most non-repetitive asymmetric key encryption. 

This is your first time seeing one, right? Well be prepared, you will not find the flag. 

I have given you this key (id_rsa file), it’s this random base64 string, no way you'll know what to do with it.

The ciphertext is 0x2085f3d3573cd709fad84bed9fe8dde419fb7c8e96aa95ec4651a3bc07b5552f321e03404943744d931a4a51a817cf190880a5efbf94aa828c45da5b31dcdefc
