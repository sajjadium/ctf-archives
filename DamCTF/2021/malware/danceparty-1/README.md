A new IR came in hot off the press and we found some fresh malware! It looks like the adversaries were stealing sensitive information from the client environment but we aren't sure yet.

Can you look at this malware and examine the configuration?

NOTE: This is real malware (created for this event), handle with care and don't blindly run it. There are safeguards in place to protect accidental infection but don't rely on them. The ZIP password is infected.
