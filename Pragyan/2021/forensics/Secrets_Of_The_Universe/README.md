The world is a mysterious and complicated place. But there are people who beleive that there can be order to this never ending chaos. They beleive that all of lives secrets can be explained away with the means of a simple ratio, a very expensive ratio. They also, for some bizzare reason don't beleive in anything grouped together. They always prefer it to be broken into its seperate parts

They beleive that everything in the world has a defined order that they must be processed in. They also strongly beleive that every bit of information is stored in a way that respects one of the ratio's most famous creators. There is a strong consensus between these people that even the least significant stuff contains a lots of very important information. As for me, I am not really a great beleiver in all this stuff, but I did attend one of their meetings, and we were all provided a wierd video and told, "As the secrets of the medium come to you, shuffling it might be a good idea". No idea what that means, but now that I am interested, I would like to go to their next meetings, but only people who understand are allowed. Could you help me out a bit here?
