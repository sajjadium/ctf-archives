osu?
======

Can you beat my super cool rhythm game?

./osu game.beatmap


if you have a recording you can do:

./osu game.beatmap game.recording


Audio
=====

If you want audio you need a SoundFont (SF2) file. You can get a nice one here from this Debian package:

http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/fluid-soundfont/fluid-soundfont_3.1.orig.tar.gz

Place it in the current directory named 'FluidR3_GM.sf2'.
