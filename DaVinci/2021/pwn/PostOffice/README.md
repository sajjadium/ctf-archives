I received a package today. A few minutes later, I received the following SMS asking me to pay for the delivery:

Chronopost: Veuillez confirmer le reglement

livraison du colis en cliquant sur le lien

I found a weird PHP backdoor while the site was still active and have access to the source code. Can you find a way to see who got scammed?
