I love Rust,
Rust or Bust.
Rust for life and 'til death do us part.
Rust of the Rings!
I do not like the garbage collector.
It always gives me strife.
It is the curse, that is our marriage,
And I will hate it until I die.
I'll run away and disavow it.
My love for it will never grow.
It used to be a healthy marriage,
But it is over now.
It was when Rust came out
And start to use the memory-safe features
As the garbage collector had no choice,
But to accept that it was over as well.
I'll not complain about memory safety.
It is a good thing, I suppose.
But when I need to mutate a single mapping,
I want to be in charge of the mapping.
I don't want to be told no,
I want to have control over the flow.
