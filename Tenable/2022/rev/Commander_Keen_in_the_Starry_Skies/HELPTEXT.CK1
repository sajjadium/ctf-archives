You can move Commander Keen with the joystick or keyboard.


When you first start Keen, you will be in keyboard mode. Let's look at the
keys you need to know to play the game.

KEY           WHAT IT DOES

Arrows        Move Keen around

Ctrl          Jump

Alt           Use Pogo/Stop Pogo
              (if you have one)

Ctrl AND Alt  Fire raygun
              (if it has charges)

You can redefine these keys by pressing F3.


OTHER IMPORTANT KEYS

Spacebar      Status screen

F1            Help!

F2            Sound on/off

F3            Keyboard mode

F4            Joystick mode

F5            Save Game

ESC           Quit


If you use the joystick, press button 1 to jump, button 2 to use the
pogo, and both to fire the raygun.  Controlling Keen while using the pogo is
more difficult.

When you are on the Mars map, you may be blocked by a city, shrine, or other
obstacle.  You must enter the city (press Ctrl or button 1) and finish it
before proceeding.

When you enter a city, you can get things by simply running into them.

If you cannot pass through a door, there may be a "keycard" that the door
requires.  This keycard will be the same color as the door.
